Under the theme “Drivers of Change,” the Women’s Economic Empowerment Global Summit (WEEGS) will take forward the important conversations on women’s advancement and empowerment in both economic and professional domains, in its upcoming second edition to be held on Dec. 10 and 11th in Sharjah.Held under the patronage of Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al-Qasimi, wife of the ruler of Sharjah and chairperson of NAMA Women Advancement Establishment (NAMA), WEEGS is organized by NAMA in collaboration with UN Women. This year’s theme reflects the summit’s dedication to bolstering discussions with international decision-makers, developing current strategies, potential opportunities and case studies that enhance equitable opportunities for women in all sectors.Reem BinKaram, director of NAMA, said: “The summit aims to develop relevant action plans and best practice mechanisms as well as identify strategies, which will widen the scope of these achievements and take them to more advanced levels.”“We look upon women in the region and the world as a united, coherent community. This vision is enshrined in our strategic partnership with UN Women and civil society organizations in many countries. It aligns with our belief that women are an indispensable human resource for the development of every nation. By helping create a better entrepreneurial ecosystem for women and enhancing their skills, we can really boost their role in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,” added BinKaram.More than 1,000 people will come together at the Al-Jawaher Reception and Convention Center (JRCC) to learn, exchange experiences, and network with high-profile officials and thought leaders on women’s empowerment, gender equity advocates, governmental, non-governmental and private sector representatives, and academics, who can influence global policies, inform grassroot actions, boost women’s career prospects in all fields and advocate the formation of inclusive work ecosystems.
