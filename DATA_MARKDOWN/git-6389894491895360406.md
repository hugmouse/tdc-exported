Sainsbury’s has reported a double-digit drop in half-year profit, underlining the a turbulent period for one of Britain’s largest grocers.
Underlying profit before tax hit £238m in the 28 weeks to 21 September 2019, slumping 15 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Statutory pre-tax profit fell from £107m to £9m, following a one-off write-down from a review of its property portfolio.
 The firm cited the “combined impact of the phasing of cost savings, higher marketing costs and tough weather comparatives”.
Group sales edged down 0.2 per cent to £16.86bn, while like-for-like sales fell one per cent.
Retail sales (excluding fuel) were down 0.6 per cent.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “We are investing in hundreds of Sainsbury’s and Argos stores, introducing new products and services and continually improving service and availability. As a result, customer satisfaction has increased significantly year on year.
“We have set out our plan to create one multi brand, multi-channel business. This will make the combined Sainsbury’s and Argos offer much more accessible for customers and gives us the opportunity to make our business more efficient.”
