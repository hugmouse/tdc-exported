Christmas is coming and the celebrations can require a lot of cleaning.
Thanks to a new Dyson vacuum cleaner for kids that actually works, parents will be able to get a helping hand from their little ones over the festive season.
The Dyson Toy Cordless Vacuum is an exact replica of the electronics brand's latest handheld DC59 model (from £229.95, Amazon ) and even makes realistic noises.
Online retailer Very is selling it for a reduced price of £17.99 (originally £19.99) - but the kids' cleaner is currently out of stock until November 23rd.
However, parents can still pre-order the item while it's on offer.
Little helpers can use the Dyson toy as a either a floor hoover or handheld cleaner, allowing them to get into all those nooks and crannies.
Once you child has helped you clean around the house, they can empty all the dirt and fluff from the accessible dust compartment.
It makes the perfect gift for Christmas and is suitable for ages three and up.
We'd advise adding one to your basket soon, though, as stock is expected to go quickly.
