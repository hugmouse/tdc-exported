Dune: The Sisterhood is down one showrunner.
Jon Spaihts, who was set to helm the HBO Max adaptation, has stepped down from the showrunner role in order to focus on the sequel to the upcoming movie adaptation of Dune. The television show was supposed to be a female-focused take on Frank Hubert’s sci-fi novel, diving into the Bene Gesserit, a mysterious order of women.
With Spaihts focusing instead on the upcoming film sequel, WarnerMedia is searching for a successor.
The upcoming 2020 movie — which is penned by Spaihts and Denis Villeneuve — boasts an impressive cast, including but not limited to: Jason Momoa, Timothee Chalamet, Stellan Skarsgard, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac. Dune will adapt Frank Hubert’s novel, a sweeping sci-fi epic about a feudal space society controlled by noble houses. Think Game of Thrones...but in SPACE.
HBO Max, meanwhile, is gearing up for a May 2020 launch, full of original and licensed content.
Dune (the movie, not the HBO Max show) is set to release in theaters on Nov. 20, 2020.
