BENGALURU: Mindtree senior vice-president and CFO Pradip Menon has resigned from the firm after spending about 13 months with the firm. Menon joined Mindtree from AkzoNobel India. Prior to that he worked for over 20 years with Unilever in multiple roles in India, Singapore, Dubai and Switzerland.
Menon joined Mindtree after his predecessor Jagannathan Chakravarthi quit. Menon was part of the core team that oversaw the transition after L&T acquired 60.6% stake in Mindtree.
When TOI contacted Mindtree, the firm said it does not have any comments to offer. Menon put in his papers a month and a half ago.
The speculation is that someone from the L&T Group will replace him.
