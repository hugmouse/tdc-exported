According to its lead designer Robert Kurvitz, stylish indie RPG Disco Elysium is headed to PS4 and Xbox One in 2020. The developer revealed the ports in a new interview with The Escapist."The immediate plan, and this is why I won’t go on a holiday anytime soon, is to get Disco Elysium to as many people as possible," Kurvitz said. "We’re going to port it next year to PlayStation and Xbox. We need to be very hands-on with the design of that. We don’t want to hire a porting company. We think it really is going to lend itself very well to console play because you don’t need to go over minute tactics and use a mouse because it’s very narrative in its nature."Disco Elysium, which launched on PC on October 15, has won over an ever-expanding following with its pulpy tale of a down-on-their-luck detective, who ventures into the beat-up city of Revachol in efforts to solve a bizarre murder case. Dialogue and psychology both play an important part of the player's interactions with locals, and the RPG has received high praise from critics and fans for its writing and tabletop stylings.Disco Elysium is available now on PC and will arrive on PS4 and Xbox One in 2020.
