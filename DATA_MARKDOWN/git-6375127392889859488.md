Since the release of the movie’s poster, several Filipino netizens have reacted adversely to the film, taking offense that it depicts colonizers in a good light, while portraying Filipino natives, including hero Lapu-Lapu, negatively.
“We will not want to preempt the jurisdiction of that agency,” Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said.
According to reports, the movie is set to be released in Philippine cinemas in January 2020.
A movie poster of a Spanish production of an animated movie entitled “Elcano and Magellan: The First Voyage Around the World” depicts an animation of Lapu-Lapu with the subhead “with Philippines very own hero Lapu-Lapu.”
The top left of the poster mentions a special highlight featuring the Battle of Mactan between Magellan and Lapu-Lapu.
Based on the trailer, the animation promises “a great adventure that will change the course of human history.”
But netizens are quick to point out that in these modern times, it is wrong to depict colonizers as heroes.
