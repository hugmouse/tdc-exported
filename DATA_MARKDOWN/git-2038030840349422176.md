Cape Town – While Kanye West's album Jesus is King, might have arrived well after it's due date and disappointed many, it still rose to the top of Billboard's album chart this week.

Kanye is now tied with Eminem for the most consecutive number ones on the Billboard 200 charts, according to the chart's data.
