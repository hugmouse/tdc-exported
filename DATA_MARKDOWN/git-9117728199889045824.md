        Robert Kubica says that he has plenty of options in F1 for 2020 as he is set to leave Williams at the end of the season. The Pole has not had the best of returns to Formula 1, despite scoring Williams' only point of the season at the German Grand Prix.
      
The one-time Grand Prix winner has been beaten 19-0 in qualifying against his British teammate George Russell, but has been linked with a development role at Haas in 2020.
"There are some new opportunities, or different opportunities," Kubica said after the United States Grand Prix last weekend.

        "We'll have to see if we can make it work. If this happens I can have a good and relaxed December, but until [then], there is no final decision and [I] have to look realistically.
      

        "Until there is no signature on the papers it's better to be realistic. It's maybe more complicated than I would like but if it's more complicated it means there are some good opportunities."
