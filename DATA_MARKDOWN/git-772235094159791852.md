The BMW iNext crossover has been spied again, although it's not clear if iNext name will carry over for production.
While the latest iNext prototype wears less camouflage than earlier vehicles, there are still plenty of false body panels, especially around the front and rear of the car, as well as around the D-pillar area.
The front fascia is largely blocked off and we're unable to see what BMW has decided to do with its signature double-kidney grille.
Unlike upcoming additions to the BMW i range such as the iX3, the iNext will have a body that's distinct from conventionally powered models, and seems to feature a clamshell bonnet and tailgate, as well as frameless side windows.
Our spy photography agency was again able to snap some photos of the iNext's interior, including the curved panel housing both the infotainment system and instrumentation displays.
We can also see the car's two-spoke steering wheel, thin central air vents, and a stubby gear transmission controller in the centre console.
Not much is known about the car's drivetrain, but the company has previously confirmed it will be available with a battery pack capable of up to 600 kilometres of driving between charges.
The car will also serve as BMW's flagship for self-driving vehicle technology, and will be capable of Level 3 autonomy. If so equipped, the car can drive itself without the driver's hands on the steering wheel, but will prompt the driver to retake command if conditions prove to be too challenging.
