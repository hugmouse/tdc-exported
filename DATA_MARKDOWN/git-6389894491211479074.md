Analysts at Peel Hunt said: “While regulatory uncertainty hangs over the sector, we believe it is unlikely the shares will make progress.”
Last month Flutter agreed to merge with Toronto-listed Stars to create one of the world’s largest gambling businesses.

We believe that this deal will accelerate delivery of all of our core strategic objectives and we are very excited about the international growth prospects for the combined group.”
Flutter’s share price fell 0.4 per cent to 7,996p.
