Cape Town – In a Rolling Stone interview with Billie Joe Armstrong, pop star Billie Eilish says she almost walked away from her successful music career after having a bad time on the road.
In the relaxed chat with the Green Day frontman, who is a big fan of hers, Billie explained that while she loves performing for her fans it was the time away from home and other factors that made the experience less enjoyable. 
In the interview she said: "I don’t mean the shows. The shows are always my favourite part. But it was just traveling and being alone all the time, on a cold bus in Europe, horrible food, and when you come back, everyone’s kind of moved on from you. This last tour I went on was the first I’ve ever enjoyed. I feel like I have this amazing thing that now I actually see."
