KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): The immediate abolition of an additional 10% surcharge of Touch ‘n Go card at the parking facilities is not possible for now as it is subject to the existing contract signed with the company.
Deputy Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Chong Chieng Jen said it was inherited from the previous government and was also a burden on consumers.
“Hence, we want to abolish it, but it is subject to the existing contract obligation. Only after the existing surcharge-based contracts expire, it will be abolished in stages,” he said in an oral question-and-answer session at the Dewan Rakyat today.
He said this in his reply to the supplementary question by Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (BN-Ayer Hitam) on the matter.
Responding to Wee’s original question about the government’s move to address the Touch ‘n Go monopoly, Chong said the monitoring carried out by the Malaysian Competition Commission (MyCC) found that the additional 10% surcharge was only applicable at outlets which offered both Touch ‘n Go and cash payment options.
