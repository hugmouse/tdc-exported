KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): The FBM KLCI rose 0.37% in early trade Monday, tracking gains at regional markets, lifted by index-linked counters including Petronas stocks.
At 9.05am, the FBM KLCI rose 5.95 points to 1,599.29.
The early gainers included Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, PPB Group Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Nestle (M) Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, Ajinomoto (M) Bhd and Hong Leong Industries Bhd.
Asian shares rose to 14-week highs on Monday as growing optimism over U.S.-China trade talks and upbeat U.S. job data boosted global investors' appetite for riskier assets, according to Reuters.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2% in early trade, having earlier touched its highest level since July 29, it said.
CGS-CIMB Retail Research said the FBMKLCI index rose 1.48% week-on-week as the US rate cut cheered the local sentiment.
“Today, both the local index-linked and lower liners stocks may gain traction from the record-breaking Wall Street close on Friday.
“Moreover, the growing US-China trade hopes could also give the local markets a boost. Resistance: 1,600 & 1,620. Support: 1,577 & 1,564,” it said.
