A SOUTH Derry business saved from administration 15 months ago has undergone a change of image.
Just weeks after announcing expansion plans and a major recruitment campaign, the once family-run Genesis bakery in Magherafelt, formerly known as Genesis Crafty, has dropped the ‘crafty’ name and changed its strapline to 'Genesis - Baking it better since ’68'.
Belfast design agency Thought Collective was commissioned to manage the rebrand, which follows the announcement that Genesis is investing £750,000 in the business and recruiting an additional 35 staff.
The new identity is also being supported with an improved and expanded product offering and newer 'greener' packaging.
The firm's executive chairman Paul Allen, who acquired the business in August last year when it went into administration, saving nearly 300 jobs, said: “We've been listening to customer feedback and have introduced a fresh, bold contemporary new look.
“Customers love our products’ traditional credentials, and with new eye-catching packaging, they will be able to see exactly what they are getting. We've also developed new recipes, with an increased shelf life and even better taste.”
The firm's commercial director JP Lyttle added: “We are committed to maintaining high-quality standards and developing innovative product ranges, and have successfully reasserted Genesis’ position as an established industry leader.
“This refreshed identity, supported by an extensive sampling campaign, new creative point of sale, digital, consumer and trade PR, will undoubtedly further build market share.”
Sam Bell, creative director with Thought Collective, said: “‘Baking it better since ’68’ was conceived to encapsulate the company’s heritage as well as its vision for the future - it’s the rally cry for a team of innovative master bakers.”
Genesis products are sold in more than 700 stores across the north, and it also produces a range of bread and cakes for many of the UK's largest and most prestigious retailers including Marks & Spencer and Waitrose.
