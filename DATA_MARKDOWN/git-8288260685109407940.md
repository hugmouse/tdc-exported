A 17-year-old youth accused of murdering a stabbing victim has been remanded in custody until later this week.
The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, is charged with murdering Cain Jackson in Rugby, Warwickshire, on Thursday October 31, a court spokesman said.
Mr Jackson, 24, was pronounced dead after emergency crews were called to Meadow Road shortly after 6pm.
His alleged killer appeared before a magistrate at Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa on Monday, and was ordered to reappear for a preliminary hearing before a Crown Court judge on Wednesday.
 
Meanwhile, police investigating the death have issued a further appeal about an altercation believed to have taken place in the Parkfield Road area at about 5.10pm on Thursday.
It is also believed "trick-or-treaters" may have seen an incident on Meadow Road, and officers are keen to speak to them as potential witnesses.
 
Officers have also asked anyone who may have found an iPhone 7 Plus in a grey case in the Parkfield Road area to come forward.
