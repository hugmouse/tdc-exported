Leicester’s difficult second album is Crystal Palace away after they embarrassed Southampton 9-0 at St Mary’s. The team will surely remain the same so Roy Hodgson will know exactly what to plan for but executing that plan is another story. Jamie Vardy in title-winning form will be close to impossible to deal with. Not to mention the task of breaking down Leicester’s defence – the league’s joint-most miserly defence with eight conceded in 10 games so far. Harry Maguire? Who? Graham Searles
