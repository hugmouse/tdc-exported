UFC fighter Conor McGregor is to enter a guilty plea in court in connection with an incident at a pub in Dublin.
The mixed martial arts star is facing a single charge of assault.
Dublin District Court was told that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is to plead guilty to the offence.
The court heard that the victim, Desmond Keogh, did not want to give a victim impact statement.
 
The victim has accepted an apology from the accused, the court was told.
Dublin District Court previously heard that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is accused of assaulting Desmond Keogh at the Marble Arch pub in Drimnagh on April 6, where McGregor was promoting his brand of whisky.
CCTV footage from the night emerged last August and had been widely shared on social media.
 
The judge remanded McGregor on continuing bail at his last hearing and he is expected to either make a plea or contest the charge when he returns to court later today.
Speaking about the incident previously, McGregor said: "Whatever comes my way, I will face it. Whatever comes my way, I deserve it. I will face this head on. I will not hide from it."
McGregor announced his retirement from mixed martial arts in March but later hinted on social media he was ready to reverse that decision.
