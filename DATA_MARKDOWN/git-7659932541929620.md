The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates criticized on Tuesday the weak stances of the European Union (EU) towards increased Israeli settlement expansion and the confiscation of Palestinian territories.In a statement, the ministry said that although it appreciates Monday's statement made by the EU on the past confiscations, “yet what about the confiscations of today and tomorrow?”It added that the EU clearly considers that by this, it “exempts itself from the responsibility and accountability according to the international law.” “The issue requires a reaction from the world countries given its danger,” it said, according to the German news agency (dpa)The EU restated that the settlement activity in the occupied territories is illegal by virtue of the international law, and it curbs the possibility of a two-state solution. It called on Israel to end all settlement activities in tandem with its obligations as an occupation power.The Palestinian ministry saw that the current Israeli approach is represented in eradicating the possibility of establishing the Palestinian state through laying hands over thousands dunam of lands in delicate regions in the West Bank.It continued that the expedited Israeli procedures in this regard reflect a fascist, racist and colonial plot, with the involvement of the US.
