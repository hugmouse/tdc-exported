Some families are all about Christmas. Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka and their twins Gideon and Harper, on the other hand, are a Halloween family. Each year, they leave fans speechless with their perfect costumes. This year, the two dads decided to nurture their nine-year-olds to become the cultured people they can be. The whole family came dressed as world-famous artworks for Halloween, and Harris showed off the members’ artsy alter egos by editing their portraits into frames. “Welcome to the 2019 Burtka-Harris Boo-seum of Art,” he captioned his photo on Instagram. “Audio guides are available in the gift shop.” Harris channeled Vincent van Gogh and his self-portrait, complete with a chopped-off ear hanging on one of the frame’s borders. Burtka embodied Salvador Dalí, mimicking the Surrealist painter’s iconic wide-eyed expression. Gideon posed with a camera as a mini Andy Warhol, while a unibrowed Harper pulled off her best Frida Kahlo gaze in resplendent garb. The family previously dressed up as “Hitchhiking Ghosts,” a “Carnival of Curiosities,” Hollywood icons, and Star Wars characters. This year, they’re a walking exhibition. See all their extravagant looks below. Advertisement Advertisement
