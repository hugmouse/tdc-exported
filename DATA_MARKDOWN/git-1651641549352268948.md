Google has rolled out the November security update to the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. Alongside the typical bug fixes and security improvements, Google has addressed an issue with the Pixel 4’s screen display refresh rate.
The firm confirmed that sometimes that Pixel 4’s display would drop behind the 90hz refresh rate under certain conditions, most notably under 75% brightness levels.
“In some conditions or situations, however, we set the refresh rate to 60Hz. Some of these situations include: when the user turns on battery saver, certain content such as video (as it’s largely shot at 24 or 30fps), and even various brightness or ambient conditions,” a Google spokesperson explained. “We constantly assess whether these parameters lead to the best overall user experience. We have previously planned updates that we’ll roll out in the coming weeks that include enabling 90hz in more brightness conditions.”
Well, now Google has done just that. Users on Reddit are now reporting the November update lets users continue to use the 90hz display rate even when the brightness drops below the previous 75% threshold.
