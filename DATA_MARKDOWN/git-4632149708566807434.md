Ayushmann Khurrana is happy about ticking off one of his long-time wishes of performing the Ganga Aarti at Varanasi. He calls himself “deeply spiritual”. “It was a surreal moment for me to do my first Ganga Aarti at Varanasi. I had always wanted to experience this moment and had thought about it since my college. I’m delighted that every single thing worked out for me to perform the Ganga Aarti. I won’t ever forget this. It was an extremely peaceful, magical and soulful feeling for me,” said Ayushmann. He went on to add, “I call myself deeply spiritual and it is a strange and lovely coincidence that before the release of my last few films, I ended up being at a place known for its spirituality. Before the release of Dream Girl, I was at Lalbaug, before the release of Badhaai Ho, I was at Vaishno Devi. It’s a lovely coincidence and I hope I get to experience such places even more,” he added.
