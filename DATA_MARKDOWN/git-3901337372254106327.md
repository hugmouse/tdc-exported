It be said that not all footballers drive flashy vehicles as some prefer the more modest approach when it comes to their wheels. That said, could this be Gabadinho Mhango's humble ride?
When it comes to the big teams, the players tend to fill their club’s parking lot with SUVs, sports hatchbacks and luxury sedans. Places for the much cheaper "starter pack" are somewhat limited.

That being said, Mhango has, in the past, taken to Instagram to post images of himself posing alongside a Volkswagen Polo.
Although not confirmed to be his ride, being pictured alongside the car more than once could well suggest that it is indeed his vehicle.
In today's market, the VW Polo is priced around the R230 000 mark, and a number of PSL footballers own keys to the ride known to be a "starter pack".
