KISS had previously planned to conclude their ‘End of the Road’ farewell tour in March 2020, but they’ve just added 75 new dates for 2020 and a final show for 2021. According to various reports, the dates were revealed on screens at this past weekend’s KISS Kruise, and they include several 2020 dates in North America, South America, Europe, and South Africa, followed by another KISS Kruise during Halloween weekend in 2020 (10/30-11/4). And — as of now at least — the New York City band will wrap things up with a final hometown show on July 17, 2021. Venue for that show (and all other newly added dates) TBA.
Before that final NYC show, KISS also play tristate area shows in 2020 in Hartford, cT on 8/29, Canandaigua, NY on 8/31, and Atlantic City, NJ on 9/4. All dates/cities are listed below.
