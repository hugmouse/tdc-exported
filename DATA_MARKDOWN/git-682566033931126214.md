Cape Town - Highlands Park coach Owen da Gama has slammed Tshegofatso Mabasa's tackle on Lindokuhle Mbatha in the 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates on Tuesday.
Mabasa was extremely lucky to escape with a yellow card as Mbatha had to receive an injection at half-time but is still set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines.
Da Gama was seen in animated conversation with Mabasa after the game and the Lions of the North tactician has revealed exactly what he said to the Buccanneers striker.
"I told him, I said, 'Boy, you cant play like that. You can’t tackle people with two-footed tackles. You will end people's careers'," Da Gama told KickOff.
"He said, 'No he (Mbatha) jumped'. I said it doesn't matter if he didn't jump it would have broken his leg.
"That should have been a red card. Two-footed tackle. Mbatha had to get an injection at half-time. He never recovered from that. He is still in pain. I don't know if he will play again."
Highlands next turn their attention to a Telkom Knockout quarter-final clash with Maritzburg United on Friday night.
Kick-off is at 20:00.
