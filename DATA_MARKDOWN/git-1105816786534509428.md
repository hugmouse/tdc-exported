Helena Bonham Carter has something in common with Princess Margaret, the character she plays in the new Netflix season of The Crown. The 53-year-old actor believes it is “much more fun” for older women to date younger men.
Bonham Carter is dating a man 21 years her junior and opened up about being with Rye Dag Holmboe, a Norwegian writer in a recent interview with The Sunday Times Magazine. She describes him as “an old soul in a young body — what more could I want?”
The Fight Club actor has two children from her previous marriage with filmmaker Tim Burton, 16-year-old Billy and 11-year old Nell. Now dating a man younger than her, she reportedly doesn’t have any concerns about their age gap.
“Everybody ages at a different rate. My boyfriend is unbelievably mature. He’s an old soul in a young body, what more could I want,” she said during the interview. “People are slightly frightened of older women, but he isn’t. Women can be very powerful when they’re older.”
The star also feels it’s fun to date older woman. “Why can’t we be sexually and romantically attractive just when our eggs are expired? Actually it’s much more fun because we’re so freed of the terror, there is no consequence, it’s all just for fun,” she added.
