A couple months ago, Amazon released its 2019 line of Echo speakers and devices. Among other things, the company announced its answer to the Apple AirPods — the Amazon Echo Buds. The company has finally released its true wireless earbuds, and customers can purchase a pair for themselves on Amazon for $129.99.
What sets the Echo Buds apart from the competition is that Amazon built Alexa right into them. That means users will have the ability to make Alexa commands even when they are on the go.
Each earbud also comes with a pair of external microphones and a single inner microphone to reduce outside noise. The Echo Buds are also IPX4 sweat resistant, and Amazon says the battery should last up to five hours of continuous music playback and four hours of constant voice calling.
The Echo Buds also cost about half as much as Apple’s new AirPods Pro. Factoring in the built-in Alexa support and relatively low price tag, the Amazon Echo Buds are some of the most compelling true wireless earbuds on the market.
