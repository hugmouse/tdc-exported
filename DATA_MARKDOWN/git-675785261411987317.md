A furious mum has hit out at drivers after being unable to get her baby in her car because of tight parking.
The unnamed mother was stunned after going shopping at Morrisons in Solihull, West Midlands and returning to her car to find she could not open the doors.
A photo shows her car door fully open with the baby in his car seat on the ground, Coventry Live reports .
The frustrated woman told on Facebook how she was then faced with a dilemma about what to do with her child, before reverse the car without him inside.
She fumed to the Solihull Facebook page: "I have a small grievance that I regularly see people park in mother and baby spots at shopping centres and supermarkets, that do not have children, or, have children that are old enough to get themselves in and out of a car safely (teenagers and nearly teenagers!), and even some older people, or just adults alone.
 
"Please be considerate when seeing these parking spaces free, people with babies do need them!
"I could not get my son into the car today with a trolley full of shopping, not because the cars either side have parked too close, but because the normal spaces just do not have enough space to allow the doors to open wide enough to fit a car seat through the doors.
"How are we supposed to get our child into the car safely... leave them at the side of the road with oncoming traffic whilst I reverse my car, put him in the boot knowing at least he’s somewhere safe while I do this (where the pram is with limited space) fetch a staff members or passer by to hold him while I reverse!!??
"Sorry for the moan, but please park considerately for every person that is travelling with babies and young children!! Thanks."
The mum said she had to ask an 'elderly pensioner to watch him' while she reversed back to open the door wide enough to put him inside.
