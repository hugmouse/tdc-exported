        Racing Point have been given planning permission for a new HQ at Silverstone. The team will extend its current facility so the team can do all their work under one roof. The building will be two stories high and could be what the team needs to help improve their performances. 
      
“Our team’s origins stem from Jordan in 1991, which is when the current building was built. But we are now known as Racing Point, and we are driven by a passion for motorsport and have clear ambitions to compete at the highest level of it," Simon Lake, a project manager for Racing Point said to the Northampton Chronicle. 

        "We want to build on the established team and location that we have, and we need to take advantage of our location at Silverstone as it’s the ideal base from which to grow.
      

        “Formula One is a highly innovative business with state-of-the-art technology and this is necessary for us to keep up with these advances.”
      
The old facilities were not adequate for a team trying to make their mark on the F1 grid and this new building should help bring the team together and lead to more success.
