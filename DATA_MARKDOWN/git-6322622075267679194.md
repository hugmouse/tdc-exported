A spokesman for the state Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia in a statement today saidthe temporary evacuation centre closed was Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Changkat Jong, Teluk Intan in Hilir Perak district, which had previously housed 47 evacuees from 11 families.
“It was officially closed by the Kerian district officer who is also the the district disaster management chairman, at 9.45am today, after remaining open since Oct 26,” he said.
The relief centre at SK Changkat Lobak in Kerian district which had earlier housed 149 flood victims from 35 families, was also closed today, he added.
