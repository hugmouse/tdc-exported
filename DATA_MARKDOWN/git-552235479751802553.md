The victims of an attempted murder bid in Greenock are in a critical condition in hospital.
Karen Branwhite, 37, and Finlay McIntyre, 52, were repeatedly knifed yesterday in a “horrendous and horrific” targeted attack.
Police said they were following a positive line of inquiry as they hunted the two attackers who carried out the stabbings at about 8.45pm on Tuesday.
Detective Inspector David Wagstaff, of Greenock CID, described the latest attack as “horrendous and horrific”.
 
He said: “This is a despicable, targeted attack on two people. They sustained knife injuries to their bodies.”
He said the victims were both being treated in a high dependency unit in Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and their condition was “critical but stable”.
Yesterday, the street was sealed off as police gathered evidence.
A resident, who did not want to be named, said: “This place is getting wild.
“I saw loads of police and the road was totally blocked off for a while. Later on, maintenance men were in cleaning the steps and outside stairs.
“It must have been like a bloodbath.”
 
Police are asking anyone with information on what happened to get in touch.
Wagstaff said: “The suspects arrived in a silver-coloured taxi and left in the same taxi.
“They then got out of the taxi in Kilmacolm Road, near to Blairmore Road. They were last spotted walking along Kilmacolm Road, going in the direction of Burnhead Street.”
Both suspects were wearing dark clothing and one had a baseball cap on.
Wagstaff added: “We are following positive lines of inquiry. Anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour on Belville Street on Tuesday night, or who may have private CCTV covering the area, is asked to come forward.
“We have a number of additional police patrols in the area. If you have any information or concerns, please speak to one of these officers.”
