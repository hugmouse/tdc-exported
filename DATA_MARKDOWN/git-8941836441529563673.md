WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) - Army has signed an agreement with the Belk Bowl to serve as the primary backup during the next six years.
Beginning next year, a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference will face a team from the Big Ten in the Belk Bowl in 2020, 2022 and 2024, and the ACC representative will play a team from the Southeastern Conference in 2021, 2023 and 2025. Should the Big Ten or the SEC fail to provide an eligible team at any point during the six-year cycle, Army would be invited to fill the vacancy.
Army director of athletics Mike Buddie announced the agreement Tuesday with the Charlotte Sports Foundation, owner and operator of the Belk Bowl.
Last month, Army announced future bowl agreements with the Independence Bowl and ESPN Events for the same period. With those announcements, Army will have primary tie-ins with the Independence Bowl in even years and an ESPN owned-and-operated bowl game in odd years in each of the next six years.
