Animal remains which washed up on a Scottish beach have left residents puzzled.
The bones, which look like a mixture between a cat and reptile, were found on the shoreline of Aberdeen beach.
A picture of the remains was posted on community page Fubar News after a local made the mysterious discovery.
But speculation is rife as to what the creature could be. The animal has a reptile like face, the ribs are exposed, a long bony tail and claws.
The post on Fubar News reads: "Found on Aberdeen Beach today. Very strange, can anyone shed some light on what we saw?"
 
Attracting over 600 comments many residents have mixed opinions on the creature, with some believing it is a cat and others a chameleon or bearded dragon.
One said: "I'm gonna say chameleon as its skull is very similar an its feet as well."
Others think it is a sea otter or badger, or a mysterious Halloween themed fake prank.
Another added: "I'm going with "FAKE" on this one...Bearded Dragon/Charmeleon head, Charmeleon tail/back feet.
"Someone broke some legs off of a crab and stuck them in the abdomen.
"It's a wax or latex creature, or a couple real creatures blended together and a little Photoshop."
