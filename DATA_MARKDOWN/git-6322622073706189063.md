KUCHING (Nov 4): Sarawak has issued a Notice of Assessment to Petronas seeking payment of the State Sales Tax (SST) on petroleum products, saying failure to do so will result in legal action.
Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg said, to date, Petronas had not yet paid the SST while other companies have done so.
“Under the SST Ordinance 1998, Petronas is legally obligated to pay SST and their failure to do so would tantamount to breach of the law,” he said.
Abang Johari, who is also the state Finance and Economic Planning Minister, said that when tabling the Supply (2020) Bill at the Sarawak Legislative Assembly sitting here today.
He said, as of Sept 30 this year, the state has collected revenue of RM5.653 billion.
