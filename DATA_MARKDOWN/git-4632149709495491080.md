Chennai: In an observation made on the impersonation scandal that has hit the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), the Madras High Court on Monday queried why can't NEET be scrapped by the Centre When the Centre is reversing almost all the schemes that were brought in by the previous UPA government, why doesn't it reverse NEET too, the court observed on Monday pointing out that it has almost become impossible to get a medical seat without going to private NEET coaching centres. As for the fee collected by such coaching centres, only those who got money can clear NEET. How can the poor afford to get such coaching? Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan asked. It was claimed that the exam was brought in to prevent passing of money to get medical seats. But now, money was passed in other ways through such coaching centres, the bench added. The court made the observations while hearing a plea related to incidents of impersonation in NEET. Recently, several people were arrested on charges of impersonation.The court earlier expressed doubts that the illegality of clearing the test through proxies would have happened across the country and not just in Tamil Nadu.
