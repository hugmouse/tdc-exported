        Charles Leclerc qualified in fourth position for the Mexican Grand Prix and will start behind both Max Verstappen and teammate Sebastian Vettel in the battle for third in the drivers' standing. The 22-year-old's team boss felt that luck wasn't on Leclerc's side.
      
"Charles was really unlucky, " Binotto told Sky Sports.
 "He missed the last free practice while we had completely changed the setup compared to Friday. The car was therefore very different compared to Friday.
 "I think Leclerc would have had a great qualification if he could have tested the car in VT3. He would have been even stronger in qualifying. "
 "When we started from pole, we didn't win the race, so we hope that we win because we don't start from pole. The tires will again be decisive."
 The  Monégasque will look to improve on his fourth-place finish in Mexico with himself, Vettel and Verstappen split up by just 16 points.
