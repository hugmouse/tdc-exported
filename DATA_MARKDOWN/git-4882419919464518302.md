FC Barcelona continue to comb the market for the best young players. Since the arrival of Patrick Kluivert as director of youth football, as well as a number of other changes in the scouting department, one of the players to catch the eye is Karim Adeyemi.
According to Transfermarkt, the Spanish champions have already made an offer of 15 million euros for the Red Bull Salzburg forward.
At 17, Adeyemi is currently playing for Salzburg's feeder club FC Liefering and is tipped to be one of the forwards to watch in the coming years. Barça have followed him for a while and all the reports on him are very positive.
Transfermarkt say that Barça's first offer to the Austrian club would not be of interest to Salzburg, who don't want to lose one of their biggest talents on the cheap.
Barcelona will continue to follow him with the idea of placing him in the B team, although they will face competition from a number of Premier League clubs.
