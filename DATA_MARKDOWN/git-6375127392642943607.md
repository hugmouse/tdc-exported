Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte broached the idea during the 43rd Cabinet meeting in Malacañang Wednesday night after the issue on climate change was raised.
Panelo said Vernice Victorio, President and CEO of the Natural Resources Development Corp., “shared with the Cabinet the Priority Programs for Environment and Climate Change Resiliency.”
“During her presentation, the President floated the idea to ban the use of plastics, which according to him would require legislative action,” he said.
Several bills on banning the use of plastics remain pending in Congress.
Sen. Francis Pangilinan has filed Senate Bill 40 which seeks a ban on the importation, manufacture and use of all single-use plastics.
Pangilinan proposed that those who violate this would be penalized and those who re-use and recycle would receive incentives.
Sen Cynthia Villar also filed Senate Bill No. 333 or the Single-Use Plastic Product Regulation Act of 2019.
Under her proposed bill, the issuance of the single-use plastics by food establishments, markets and retailers would be prohibited.
