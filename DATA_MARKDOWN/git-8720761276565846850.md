Samsung's Exynos flagship processors have been a mainstay for years now, and they've mostly featured Samsung's Mongoose custom CPU cores. Unfortunately, the Korean brand is now shutting down its custom CPU division. From a report: Samsung filed a Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) letter in Texas, according to The Statesman, notifying the state that 290 employees will be laid off as part of its CPU unit being shut down. The layoffs reportedly go into effect from December 31. The Korean manufacturer confirmed the news to Android Authority, while also explaining the reasoning behind the decision. "Based upon a thorough assessment of our System LSI [large scale integration - ed] business and the need to stay competitive in the global market, Samsung has decided to transition part of our U.S.-based R&D teams in Austin and San Jose," the company told us in a statement, adding that it remained committed to its US workforce.
