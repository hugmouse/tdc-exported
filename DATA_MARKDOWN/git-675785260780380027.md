Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is planning the biggest programme of home improvement since the post-war housing boom.
It would see all 27 million homes in the land offered upgrading with state-of-the-art energy savers.
Labour ’s Warm Homes For All scheme to be unveiled on Sunday  will create 450,000 construction jobs to fit the loft insulation, solar power and double glazing needed.
The plan is to prevent 1,500 winter deaths and 565,000 cases of asthma as homes are made healthier by 2030.
And installing low carbon high-tec will cut emissions by 10 per cent, the equivalent of taking seven in ten cars off the road.
Low income households will stump no money up front but gradually pay back some of what they owe from the £417 a year projected savings in energy bills.
Wealthier households will be offered interest free loans to improve their homes.
Mr Corbyn said: “If we don’t radically change course we face the threat of a hostile and dying planet.
“We can either take action to protect future generations, or allow the Tories to help fuel our planet’s destruction.”
Labour estimates a cost of £250 billion to upgrade homes nationwide and the state will contribute £60billion of that.
The remainder will come from the energy savings generated.
