Rangers have a clean bill of health for their Europa League clash against Porto at Ibrox.
The Ibrox side take on their Portuguese rivals on Thursday night with a fully fit European squad to pick from.
Injured winger Jordan Jones isn't included in the 22-man squad while the likes of Greg Docherty and Jamie Murphy also aren't named.
Scott Arfield will be hoping for a recall to the starting lineup after being benched for Sunday's Betfred Cup win over Hearts.
Greg Stewart missed out completely and will hope to be involved but Steven Gerrard is unlikely to make many changes to his side.
Rangers and Porto are tied on four points apiece in Group G, with Young Boys top on six points and Feyenoord bottom on three.

        Predicted lineup
      

        Rangers provisional squad:
