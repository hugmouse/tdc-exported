A disgraced Walsall police officer who was sacked for stealing cans of Carling has been jailed for heinous child sex offences.
Ross O‘Grady originally pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sexual assault against three victims between during a two-year campaign of abuse from 2014 and 2016.
The 47-year-old of High Street, Brownhills, later pleaded guilty to five offences during a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court and was sentenced to 13 years in prison and will be placed on the sex offender register for life on Wednesday, October 30.
O’Grady was dismissed by the force on June 10, 2016, for gross misconduct relating to an unrelated theft matter.
He claimed he had been suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and needed the cans of Carling for medicinal purposes because he saw “dead babies, murdered bodies and guns in his face” when he tried to sleep.
But the sexual offences then came to light in 2017 when the victims courageously came forward to report the crimes.
They also relived their trauma at court, so West Midlands Police could bring O’Grady to justice.
 
The police investigation determined that some of these offences were carried out while he was a serving police officer.
Detective Sergeant Sam Kirk, from the public protection unit at West Midlands Police, said: "O’Grady’s behaviour was despicable. He held a position of trust and he abused this by committing these heinous crimes.
“I commend the bravery of his victims, it has been an extremely traumatic time for them.
 
“There is no place in society for this kind of behaviour and O’Grady must now serve time behind bars."
