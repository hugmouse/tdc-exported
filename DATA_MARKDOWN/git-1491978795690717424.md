        Charges over attack in August on Guardian journalist deemed too serious for lower court
      
Three men charged with offences related to a late-night assault on Guardian journalist Owen Jones outside a pub in Islington, north London will have their case heard in a crown court.
At a short hearing on Wednesday morning, a magistrates court sent the case to Snaresbrook crown court because the charges were deemed too serious to be dealt with by the lower court.
Jones, 35, said he had been celebrating his birthday with friends when he was attacked at about 2am outside the Lexington public house in Islington, north London on 17 August.
James Healy, 39, from Portsmouth; Liam Tracey, 34, from Camden, London; and Charlie Ambrose, 29, from Brighton, had been charged with actual bodily harm and affray.
They did not enter a plea at the hearing and spoke only to confirm their names, address and nationality. They were told they had to appear at Snaresbrook crown court on 4 December.
The three were granted bail subject to two conditions: not to make contact with Jones in any way, and not to enter the Lexington pub until the trial concludes.
