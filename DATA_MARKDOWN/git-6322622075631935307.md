KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): Velesto Energy Bhd said its unit has bagged a contract worth US$131 million (RM541.17 million) from Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd.
Carigali Hess, an oil and gas joint venture between PCJDA Ltd and Hess Oil Company of Thailand Ltd, is involved in gas production in the joint development area administered by the Malaysian-Thailand Joint Authority.
Velesto said in an exchange filing today that the contract, awarded to its indirect wholly-owned unit Velesto Drilling Sdn Bhd, is for the provision of a 10K jack up drilling rig.
The contract will commence in the second half of 2020 for a duration of three years, with three extension options of six months each.
Velesto said its NAGA 8 premium independent-leg cantilever jack-up rig will be used. It has a drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet, and a rated operating water depth of 400 feet.
Velesto said the provision of the services is expected to contribute positively towards its earnings and net assets during the contract period for the financial period ending Dec 31, 2020.
