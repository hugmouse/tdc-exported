Yangon University Students’ Union organized a campaign against the cutting down of trees in the compound of Yangon University on November 3.
Ko Hayman Soe Nyunt, General Secretary of the Yangon University Students’ Union said: “Our Student Union stick the posters reading “Don’t cut down the trees” and “this is the university campus” (they are not government-owned), on the trees marked with the red-X. According to the verbal promise, they will cut down 76 trees for the ring road in the university. There are more than 100 trees marked with the red-X. They cut down some trees on the side of Thaton hostel. They have yet to cut down more than 100 trees.”
On October 31 and November 1, Yangon University Students’ Union and the university authority held a talk on the excessive cutting of trees in the compound of Yangon University.
On November 2, the Students’ Union also made a demonstration, calling for stopping tree-cutting and not giving the priority to superficial changes.
On October 2, the Student Union issued a statement opposing the works that destroy the greening and ecosystem of the campus. The use of funds on the superficial changes before the centenary of Yangon University instead of using these funds in other necessary educational field, is not suitable.
Yangon City Development Committee is carrying out tree cutting with the permission of university authority.
