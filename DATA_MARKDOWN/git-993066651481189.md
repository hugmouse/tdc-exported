IRELAND'S oldest water bottling company Classic in Lurgan has made a second significant announcement in a month after revealing it was pumping money into its manufacturing facilities to more than double output capacity from 8,000 to 20,000 units an hour.
The investment, backed by Ulster Bank and Lombard, is part of a company plan to return a five-fold increase in sales by expanding its presence in Ireland and entering the GB market over the next three years.
And it comes after Classic, established in 1948, revealed in October that it was investing £3.7 million (helped by £550,000 from Invest NI) into the company to increase capacity and help quadruple sales from £2.5 million to £10m in a move which will create 40 jobs.
The latest bank-backed initiative has seen it purchase and commission two new cutting-edge automated production lines which will increase output and enable an almost 30 per cent reduction in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) per bottle.
Bottled at source, the company has five on-site wells commissioned which can supply its production lines with up to 100,000 litres an hour.
Classic's owner and chief executive Liam Duffy said: “We have an excellent, quality-driven proposition compared to other competitors in the marketplace.”
“As the only company in Northern Ireland with certified natural mineral water status we are well positioned to capitalise on opportunities in the soft drinks and beverage sector with a locally-sourced and premium product.”
He added: “The support of Ulster Bank and Lombard has enabled us to revolutionise an historic bottling company by introducing industry-leading technologies.
“These are aiding growth in our current markets and their increased capacity ensures we are future-ready and able to scale our operations in response to heightened demand as we break into new and emerging markets.”
Ulster Bank's commercial banking senior relationship manager Caroline McKeown said: “The investment will enable Classic's new management team to propel what is a traditional business into the 21st century through the integration of high-capacity automated production facilities.
“As one of Northern Ireland's standout FMCG producers, we are pleased to provide finance to Classic Mineral Water Company to put in place the facilities that will equip the company with the means to expand its presence throughout the UK and Ireland.”
Declan Napier, relationship director at Lombard, added: “Investing in the latest equipment is key to maximising the operational efficiency of the business and realising its growth potential. Our support has enabled the company to acquire new, innovative production lines that will secure the future of the company by boosting revenue and profitability.”
