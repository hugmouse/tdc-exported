Murder accused Joanne Threshie’s husband told a jury yesterday that fellow police officers gave him sensitive information about a break-in at his home.
But he denied deliberately passing it on to his wife, who is on trial for the murder of Frederick McGettigan, 51, in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, on August 6, 2017.
 
Mum-of-three Threshie, 37, also from Bishopbriggs, is accused of giving her cousin Kirk McIntyre, who is serving life for the murder, Frederick’s name and address, and inciting and encouraging him to perpetrate serious violence.
It is alleged she did so because she believed Frederick had broken into her home and stolen items.
William Threshie, 37, who resigned from the police in June 2018 after serving for eight years, told the High Court in Glasgow his wife overheard him speaking about Frederick on the phone.
 
He said she was “heartbroken” but not angry after the break-in and added: “Joanne doesn’t have a bad bone in her body.”
Threshie denies murder.
The trial continues.
