The Limpopo outfit extended their winless run to six matches across competitions following the goalless draw with Sundowns on Wednesday night.
“It was a very tough game like we anticipated. I said Sundowns would come they would throw everything on us which they did, it was a wonderful game,” Nyirenda told SuperSport after the game.
“My players have accounted themselves very well. Sometimes I think we gave the too much room to play. We were supposed to press them.
“In the first 25 minutes we did what we planned and we almost got the two goals from the two chances. But after that we gave them too much room.
“We dropped towards the centre and started pressing them from there, but if you give Sundowns that bigger space behind they will kill you. But the good thing is we have the point to build on to
“Ja, not easy especially playing a team so formidable and so mature, at home I think we did well. For a start we have a draw, let’s see what we can do in the next game."
