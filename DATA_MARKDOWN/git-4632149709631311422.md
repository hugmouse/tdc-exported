After PC Mohan, Bengaluru Central MP on Thursday met Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi to expedite the suburban rails project, it has been decided that a meeting will be held in New Delhi on November 4 to discuss the project. Post the meeting, Suresh Angadi and the Railway Board Chairman will arrive in Bengaluru on November 5th to discuss the project with the State Government. During the upcoming parliamentary session, all MPs from Karnataka will meet the Prime Minister to discuss Suburban railway implementation. In other news, trains will stop at Devanahalli Halt near the Kempegowda International Airport. The move was announced after Member of Parliament Tejasvi Surya’s elaborate discussion with Divisional Railway Manager of Bengaluru on Thursday. With the Halt Station coming up at Devanahalli, Surya has asked for services to the Airport be made available at the earliest. The DRM, Ashok Kumar Verma, has assured that two trains from KSR Bengaluru heading towards Devanahalli or beyond will be given a stoppage at Devanahalli Halt as it takes more than 2 or 2.5 hours for anyone in the city to reach the Airport due to the saturated traffic.
