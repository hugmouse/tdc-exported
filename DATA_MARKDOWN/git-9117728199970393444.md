        Lewis Hamilton was critical of Max Verstappen's driving style in the run-up to the US Grand Prix but has revealed that the two "embraced" before the race. After the race the Red Bull Racing driver was quick to congratulate the Mercedes driver on his sixth World Title and it seems that any tension between the two is no longer there. 
      
"I spoke to Max before the race. We stood side by side on the grid. We kind of embraced each other," Hamilton said to Ziggo Sport. "I said something, he said something too and we left it behind. I have so much respect for that boy."
Verstappen is regarded as one of the fastest drivers on the grid and Hamilton can see the talent. 

        "He is doing a great job and he is a future world champion. I also thought: Let's make it a great race today. I think we did that, so that's great. 
        I hope we continue to fight with each other in the coming years."
      
Formula 1 fans will hope that the two continue to race wheel to wheel for years to come and that things are closer between them next season.
