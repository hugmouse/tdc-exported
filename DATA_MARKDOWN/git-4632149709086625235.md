One song that has remained a sensation since its release 40 years ago is ‘If You Come Today,’ from the James Bond inspired Operation Diamond Racket. The English song in a Kannada film was an instant sensation in the last of the ‘James Bond series’ of films of Rajkumar in 1978. In the age of Internet, the song has gone viral every few years. There have been numerous re-renderings, cover copies, remixes and adaptations. Despite its everlasting popularity, Kannada films did not try to have another full-length English song since then. Vinay Bharadwaj has changed that. His debut film Mundina Nildana has a full-length English song. Srinidhi Venkatesh, who had worked with AR Rahman has written the lyrics and composed the music along with Kumaran Sivamani (son of Sivamani the drummer). Srinidhi has also sung this English song with Agustine Abagus providing the rap. The song is named Life of Partha.
