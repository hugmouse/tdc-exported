The Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘Maha’ over the Arabian Sea has intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) and is now less than 800 kilometres away from Karachi, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said on Sunday.
The latest PMD advisory said the storm had moved northwestwards over the past 12 hours and was “at a distance of about 794 km south of Karachi with maximum sustained surface winds of 120-140 kmph.”
The department clarified that none of Pakistan’s coastal areas were presently threatened by the tropical cyclone.
“Currently, there is no threat to Pakistan’s coastal areas. However, fishermen are advised to remain careful and avoid going into deep sea from Monday,” read the advisory.
 
As per the PMD, the storm was “likely to track further west/northwestwards during [the] next 24 hours and then recurve in east-northeast direction towards Indian Gujarat.”
The threat of Cyclone Maha comes just a week after Cyclone Kyarr caused a tidal surge and raised the sea level along Karachi’s coastline.
Coastal localities and villages of Hawkes Bay, Ibrahim Hyderi, Lath Basti, Rehman Para, Rehri Goth and others were inundated, while seawater also entered parts of Defence Housing Authority Golf Club in DHA Phase-VIII and Karachi Boat Club in Clifton.
