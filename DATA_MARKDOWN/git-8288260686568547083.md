A star of The Chase left fans shocked tonight - by issuing a brutal assessment of his choice of clothing.
Paul Sinha, also known as the Sinnerman, is one of five Chasers rolled out by the ITV1 daytime favourite.
The Chase, presented by Bradley Walsh, sees Sinha - or his co-stars Mark Labbett, aka the Beast, Shaun 'Dark Destroyer' Wallace, Anne 'The Governess' Hegerty or Jenny Ryan, aka the Vixen - go up against a team of four contestants.
Tonight, Paul clashed with somebody on the show looking to land a life-changing sum - and he left social media users all commenting on his brutal words.
Paul, 49, was up against Tim, who presenter Bradley welcomed onto the show.
Tim, 58, from Cheshire, was being spoken to by former Coronation Street star Brad when Paul interjected: "I am just a little bit distracted, because with a quizzers brain, I am just ranking the ten worst shirts I have seen in my life and you are in at number seven."
Tim said: "Can I just say, my shirt at number seven, I thought that was an insult, I should be at number one."
The Sinnerman hit back, though, saying: "Obviously, you haven't seen as many bad shirts as I have over the years."
But Bradley Walsh wasn't having it, and rushed to Tim's defence, saying: "Some of them belonging to me, no doubt."
