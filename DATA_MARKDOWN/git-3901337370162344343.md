It appears that footballers playing with their socks low is becoming a trend these days, with a number of locally-based players adopting it. Check it out!
In Europe, players such as Juventus star Paulo Dybala and Manchester United's Jesse Lingard sport low socks during games, so low that, to the naked eye, it appears that they wear no shin guards.

In the PSL, Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Kearyn Baccus is one of the more recognise players in the squad who play with their socks well below their shins.
The Cape Town City duo of Ebrahim Seedat and Craig Martin also prefer the lowered socks look, while the Mamelodi Sundowns pair of Tiyani Mabunda and Themba Zwane also have their own version.
