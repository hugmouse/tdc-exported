Walt Harris will not be fighting in the main event of UFC Washington next month against Alistair Overeem, as the search for his missing stepdaughter Aniah Blanchard continues.
MMA Junkie first reported Harris’ withdrawal from the fight, the UFC is yet to make an official announcement. UFC Washington takes place on December 7th at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C, and as of now Overeem remains without an opponent on the card.
Blanchard, 19, went missing near Auburn, Alabama late Wednesday evening last week (October 23rd). Her car was found two days later over fifty miles away from the location she was reported missing, and forensics identified Blanchard was likely harmed and the victim of foul play.
Since her disappearance, several figures from the MMA community such as UFC president Dana White, light heavyweight champion Jon Jones ,and manager Ali Abdelaziz have offered large cash rewards for any information that leads to Blanchard being found.
