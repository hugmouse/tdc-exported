Dundalk FC 1-1 Shamrock Rovers 
Rovers win 4-2 on penalties

        Shamrock Rovers denied Dundalk FC the domestic treble in this afternoon's FAI Cup final.
      
Aaron McEneff's penalty on the stroke of 90 minutes looked certain to settle a tightly-fought affair, but three minutes into stoppage time another Derry man, Michael Duffy, sent a half-volley skyward to the net as The Lilywhites sent the game to extra-time, where there were no further goals.
The winners converted all four of their efforts, while Duffy (bar) and Daniel Cleary (saved) saw theirs come up short as Rovers ended a 32-year wait on an FAI Cup triumph.
Stephen Bradley's men shaded a poor first half in which Dundalk had the better opportunities, with both Brian Gartland and Cleary going close from headers.
The second period was an even struggle, Seán Murray and Graham Burke exchanging efforts on target, before the latter's mazy run and pass at the death saw Aaron Greene taken down by Gary Rogers - McEneff sent the Rovers supporters wild with the finish.
However, just as The Hoops could taste sweet victory, Duffy came up with a sensational strike to enforce an additional 30 minutes and subsequently penalties, where Vinny Perth's side suffered a painful demise.
