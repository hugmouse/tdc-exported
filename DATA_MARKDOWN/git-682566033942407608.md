Paris - Gael Monfils missed the chance to secure the last place at the ATP Tour Finals as Canadian youngster Denis Shapovalov dealt the home favourite a heavy defeat in the Paris Masters quarter-finals on Friday.
Italian Matteo Berrettini, who lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round at Bercy, claims the final spot for the end-of-season event in London which starts on November 10.
The 20-year-old Shapovalov blew Monfils away with a totally one-sided 6-2, 6-2 victory in only 59 minutes.
The world No 28 will face either Rafael Nadal or French wildcard Tsonga in the fourth Masters semi-final of his career.
Shapovalov raced through the opening set in under half an hour before reeling off the first four games of the second in front of a stunned French crowd.
The 13th seed Monfils managed to salvage some pride with a couple of late holds, but Shapovalov wrapped up the win with his fifth ace on his first match point.
US Open semi-finalist Berrettini, who has won two ATP titles this year and climbed to a career-high world ranking of ninth, will be playing in the Tour Finals for the first time.

        List of the eight players to have qualified for the ATP Tour Finals in London, which start on November 10, after Italy's Matteo Berrettini took the final spot on Friday:
      
Rafael Nadal (ESP), Novak Djokovic (SRB), Roger Federer (SUI), Daniil Medvedev (RUS), Dominic Thiem (AUT), Stefanos Tsitsipas (GRE), Alexander Zverev (GER), Matteo Berrettini (ITA)
