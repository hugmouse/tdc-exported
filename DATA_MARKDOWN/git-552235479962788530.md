A charity regulator has contacted Irvine Bay Gymnastics after receiving a “concern about financial renumeration” at the Quarry Road club.
The sport’s governing body has also received a “concern” about the club and has launched its own procedures.
A spokesperson for the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator said: “We have received a concern about financial renumeration and written to the charity for more information. We cannot comment any further at this stage.”
A spokesperson for Scottish Gymnastics said: “A concern has been raised and Scottish Gymnastics is following due process under our complaints procedure.”
A Facebook post from Irvine Bay Gymnastics Club stated on Monday that they were “fully involved with the process of investigating these complaints”.
It added: “We have no doubt that a robust and transparent investigation will be undertaken and are happy to be involved in this.”
The club, which was formed in 2009, has won several accolades including North Ayrshire Sports Club of the Year 2015, UK Sports Club of the Year in 2014 and the North Ayrshire Provost’s Civic Pride Award for Sport in 2012.
