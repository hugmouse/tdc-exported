KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Malaysia is looking to locate at least RM18 billion worth of further assets linked to a scandal at state fund 1MDB, and is working with at least five nations to recover the amount, its anti-corruption chief said today.
US authorities say about US$4.5 billion (RM18.68 billion) was siphoned from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in a scandal spanning several countries.
“This what we’re working on... to locate, investigate and research where these properties are,” Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission, told reporters.
“As you know it’s not just a one-off transaction, it’s multiple transactions, so we need to work together with the countries to help us.” — Reuters
