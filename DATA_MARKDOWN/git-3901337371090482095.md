He enjoyed an illustrious career that saw him feature for the likes of Ajax Amsterdam, FC Porto, Celta Vigo, Blackburn Rovers and West Ham.

His collection included a stunning personalized Bentley, a host of Porsches, including the Panamera, an Escalade, and the footballer’s favourite, the Range Rover Sport.
