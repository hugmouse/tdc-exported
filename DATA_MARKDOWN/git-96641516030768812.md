If you've been patiently waiting for a retailer to put Sony's excellent WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones on sale, your patience has paid off. Amazon has discounted both the black and silver models by $72, making them $278 instead of their usual $350. According to price tracker Camelcamelcamel, that 21 percent price cut is the biggest discount Amazon has ever offered on the Bluetooth headphones.
We absolutely loved the WH-1000XM3 when we reviewed them late last year, awarding them a score of 94. Even with the new competition that has entered the space since Sony released the WH-1000XM3, they're still the best Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones you can buy. They feature best-in-class noise cancellation, 30 plus hours of battery life on a single charge, USB-C fast charging and a very comfortable fit. Moreover, unlike some other premium wireless headphones, they support almost every Bluetooth audio codec under the sun, including aptX HD and AAC -- which helps with latency and signal quality. The only thing we didn't like about the WH-1000XM3 was their touch controls, which can be finicky in some situations.
