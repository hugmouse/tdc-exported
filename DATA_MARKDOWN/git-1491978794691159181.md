Southampton may not relish a second trip to the Etihad Stadium in five days while Manchester City will not be daunted by facing a team they beat 3-1 on Tuesday in the EFL Cup and who were defeated 9-0 in their last league outing. Pep Guardiola’s side remain six points behind Liverpool so will be focused on not allowing a slip-up against the south-coast club that would represent a major shock. Jamie Jackson
