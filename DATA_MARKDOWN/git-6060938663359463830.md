Bollywood beauty, Ileana D’Cruz has been stealing headlines, one sensual photo at a time. After soaking up plenty of sun in itsy bitsy bikinis by the pool, the actress has headed back to work to kick off promotions for her upcoming film ‘Pagalpanti’.
Keeping in mind the scorching Mumbai heat, the actress kept things simple yet sexy in a colour coordinated outfit that featured her in a bra-top and a matching velvet blazer that she paired with pink pants and trendy transparent heels. With bright red lips and her hair worn down, the actress completed her look.
The beauty was joined by her hunky co-star John Abraham for their round of promotional activities at a hotel in the city.
Also starring Arshad Warsi, Urvashi Rautella, Pulkit Samrat and Kriti Kharbanda, the comedy, directed by Anees Bazmee is slated to release on November 22.
