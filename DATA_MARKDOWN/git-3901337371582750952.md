It appears that BMW is a brand many Kaizer Chiefs stars have opted for when visiting the car dealerships. Today, we take a look at some of the flashiest BMWs owned by Amakhosi stars. Check it out!
As the owner of one of the more luxurious rides at Chiefs, midfielder Willard Katsande can be seen pulling up to training sessions in what is known as a BMW X6. Although he is considered to be a hardman on the field, Katsande seems to prefer the more sophisticated approach off it with his X6.
Rivalling Katsande is fellow midfielder George Maluleka, who owns an older version of the X6, while a Jeep Wrangler also sits snug inside his garage.

Defender Daniel Cardoso takes both the old school and new school approach when it comes to his rides, with a BMW 1 Series and a 325i "gusheshe" parked inside his garage.
Goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma has often taken to his social media pages to post images of himself posing alongside his BMW 1 Series, while defender Siyabonga Ngezana is said to be the owner of a BMW 3 Series.
