KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Malaysia's exports likely fell in September for the second successive month due to a drop in palm oil shipments, but at a slower pace than in August, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The median forecast among 11 economists surveyed was for September's exports to decline 0.1% from a year earlier, slower than the 0.8% contraction seen in the previous month.
Imports in September however are expected to climb 1.1% year-on-year, recovering from a sharp 12.5% drop the month before, the poll showed.
Malaysia reports trade data in ringgit.
Malaysia's trade surplus likely widened to RM14.4 billion (US$3.46 billion) in September from August's RM10.9 billion.
