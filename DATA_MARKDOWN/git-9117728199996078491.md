        Daniel Ricciardo finished a respectable sixth place at the United States Grand Prix and the Australian has been reflecting on a fun race at the Circuit of the Americas.
      
After qualifying ninth for the US Grand Prix, Ricciardo made a great start to the race and was up to P6 by lap two and up to P5 by lap eight. The Australian had a running battle with Lando Norris and he had to hold him off in the closing stages.
Following the race, Ricciardo admitted this was one of his favourite races this season and was pleased with the respectable points return.
“We’ve had a lot of fun races this year and this one is certainly up there," Ricciardo told the Renault website.

        "The one-stop was the plan and it looked like others on the two-stop would get close at the end, which made things a bit nervy. We reached our target of beating both McLarens, so that’s really pleasing. It was a strong race and we showed good pace.
      

        "I enjoyed the battle with Lando [Norris] as I passed him and he passed me back a couple of times at the start and then put some pressure on towards the end. We held on for sixth, so it’s solid points for the team with Nico in the top ten as well.”
