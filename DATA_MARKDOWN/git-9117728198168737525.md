        Nico Hulkenberg was ousted out of his Renault seat in favour of Esteban Ocon. Only two seats hold realistic options in Formula 1 and it doesn't look like it'll be Hulkenberg filling either. With Williams, Nicholas Latifi seems to be the lucky one, with Alfa Romeo Racing they will most likely continue with Antonio Giovinazzi. Hulkenberg is likely to leave for the DTM to work with the BMW team. 
      
The Italian branch of Motorsport knows that the German has accepted the offer from BMW and will come with an official confirmation on Tuesday. After the 2019 season in Formula 1, the cheerful Hulk disappears from F1. 
Hulkenberg will be replaced next season by Esteban Ocon, who returns to Formula 1 after a year's absence.
