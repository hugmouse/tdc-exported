Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have managed to take out some time from their busy professional schedules and headed to Bhutan to spend some quality time together. The Indian skipper also rang in his birthday earlier this week with his wife in the beautiful valleys of the Himalayas.
Virat recently took to social media to share a few delightful pictures with his beautiful wife and shared his peace of mind as he captioned these photos as "When you get a chance to come close to the beauty of nature, thoughts cease and you become one with the moment and merge with the divine energy. So grateful ❤️😇"
Not only these pictures but the couple shared a couple of more pictures of themselves having breakfast in the lap of Himalayas on their Instagram stories.
The couple has also been sharing some adorable pictures from the picturesque location giving all their fans some major relationship as well as travel goals.
Meanwhile, on the professional front, Anushka is yet to announce her next project while Virat is on a break and would soon return on the pitch.
