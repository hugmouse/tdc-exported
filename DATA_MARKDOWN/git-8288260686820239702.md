Nicole Scherzinger has left X Factor Celebrity viewers stunned - after breaking the rules of the show live on air.
The Pussycat Dolls singer broke the rules on Saturday night as millions tuned into the ITV1 show on November.
Controversially, Nicole decided to go against her own acts - and decided to give group Try Star her safe seat.
Nicole's chair was given to the lads after an emotional performance of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.
The boys performed the hit on Saturday night's show - hours removed from England losing the Rugby World Cup final to South Africa in Japan.
Eddie Jones's side went down to the southern hemisphere side in Japan, losing at Yokohama Stadium.
 
Try Star are made up of rugby stars Ben Foden, Thom Evans and Levi Davis.
The trio are in Simon Cowell's category but he had already given his safe seat to Love Island collective No Love Lost.
But Nicole was so moved that she threw the rule book out of the window.
 
After some chanting from the crowd, she made the bold move by getting out of her seat and hitting the golden buzzer for Try Star.
She then told presenter Dermot O'Leary: "I had to do it for England and I had to do it for the boys."
