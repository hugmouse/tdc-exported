BritBox will now offer all of the UK's main TV channels in one place.
Originally rolled out to the US so that anglophiles could get their fill of UK TV programming, some genius decided that we could use that very same streaming service here in the UK, where we can just pop the telly on and watch those shows live, or through the various streaming services already on offer. And now Channel 4 has joined the fray, meaning you can catch up on content from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, all in one place.
The lure of the service is its BritBox exclusive content, because otherwise, you could catch the films and TV shows literally anywhere else. The app recently offered a free 30-day trial ahead of its impending launch which will see it roll out for £5.99 a month.
While the service is expected to make its debut this year, Channel 4 content won't hit the platform until 2020. Meanwhile, programmes from the UK channels will be available on BritBox once they've done the run on their own respective streaming and catch up services like BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All 4, so when we're already sick to the teeth of them and have moved on to fresh new content.
