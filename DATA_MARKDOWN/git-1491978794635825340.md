A man who was arrested by Queensland police has been found dead in the back of a police car while being taken to a watch house.
Police arrested the 46-year-old early on Friday morning over an incident involving a 33-year-old woman in a Rockhampton hotel car park.
“Officers arrested the Rockhampton man for breach of a domestic violence order,” a police statement said.
“Initial investigations indicate the man struggled with police before being restrained and transported to Rockhampton watch house.”
But he was found unresponsive in the back of the police vehicle when it arrived at the watch house around 3.50am and was declared dead at the scene.
The state coroner has been notified and the Crime and Corruption Commission will oversee a Queensland police investigation into the incident.
