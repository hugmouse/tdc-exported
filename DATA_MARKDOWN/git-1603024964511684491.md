In the coal block auction held earlier, Balco, part of Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd, had emerged as the highest bidder for Gare Palma IV/1.
The government had, however, rejected its bid and appointed Coal India Ltd as the designated custodian for the mine.
Gare Palma IV/1 coal block in the Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh has a total mineable reserves of 114.16 million tonne (extractable as per mining plan).
The coal block was owned by JSPL before the Supreme Court in 2014 cancelled 204 coal mines allocated to the different government and private companies since 1993 under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973.Special Thursday Expiry on 10th 7th NovEarly Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
