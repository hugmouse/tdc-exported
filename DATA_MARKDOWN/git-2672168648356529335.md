Thar Tun Sein, an in-charge of the Maungdaw Border Trade Camp said: “We have to ship onion by three vessels a day. Sometimes, we ship onion by five vessels. On November 3, we exported around 75 tons of onion. The export volume is not regular. The onion-loaded trucks arrive in the border trade camp every day. The most export item is onion with more than 1,000 tons.”
Currently, Myanmar exports 40 to 80 tons of onion via Maungdaw border trade jetty a day. Despite the arrival of onion at Maungdaw border, the onion price is still high. The price of onion increased from Ks 1,500 in October to Ks over 2,000 per viss in early November. Likewise, Myanmar exports onion via Sittwe Border Trade.
