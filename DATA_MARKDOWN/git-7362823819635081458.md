A man and woman stole handbags worth more than $20,000 from a Jimmy Choo store in New York City on Wednesday, authorities said.
The suspects, both wearing dark hoodies, entered the store at Madison Avenue and 62nd Street at around 11:35 a.m. and started grabbing items off the shelves, an NYPD spokesperson told Fox News.
Police said the pair then ran out of the store and got into a blue Jeep SUV with North Carolina license plates, before fleeing north on Madison Avenue.
