With the next Soweto Derby on the horizon, it's now been revealed that former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo will return to the fixture for the half-time show of the crunch tie. Check it out!
Fans will no doubt be excited at the prospect of seeing Khuzwayo putting on his gloves again following his premature retirement from the game earlier this season – the shot-stopper was forced to hang up his boots and gloves, if you like, after it emerged that he had a career-threatening foot injury.

Nonetheless, the PSL has now released a statement in which they revealed that Khuzwayo would be part of the upcoming Soweto Derby half-time showpiece.
"Brilliant Khuzwayo, a man who has played for both Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, will return to a stadium that is all too familiar to him when he stands between the goal posts for the half-time Absa Premiership Woza Nazo Shootout," a PSL press release read.
"At half-time, Absa will continue with the popular Woza Nazo Shootout that will see the sixth football supporter this season winning an instant cash prize of R100 000.
"During half-time, five Absa customers will be brought to the pitch to kick against recently retired former Amakhosi and Buccaneers goalkeeper Khuzwayo, in a sudden death competition to determine the winner."
