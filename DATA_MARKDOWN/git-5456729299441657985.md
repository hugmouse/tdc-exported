A member of the House of Representatives, Ikengboju Gboluga (PDP-Ondo), has appointed 60 of his party supporters as personal aides.
In a statement issued by his Media Consultant, Israel Fagbemigun, on Friday in Abuja, Mr Gboluga said the appointments were “in recognition of their contributions.”
Mr Gboluga, who represents Okitipupa/Irele Federal Constituency of Ondo State, said the appointees would work with him in providing service to his constituents.
The lawmaker said the appointments were to give the new aides “a sense of belonging and financial appreciation.”
According to him, the decision to appoint the unprecedented high number of aides is in recognition of their contributions to his election victory.
The lawmaker said many others who did not make the list will be appreciated and rewarded in upcoming empowerment programmes.
Some of those appointed included Niyi Akinnola, Chief of Staff and Daso Feyiropo, Special Adviser on Special Duties.
Others were Akin Emorioye, Oriola Akinrinwa, Tayo Ogungbemi, Omololu Akinbo, Dami Olowodugba, Gbenga Adeyehun, Olapade Omowole, Kunle Balogun and John Belie both appointed as Special Advisers.
The lawmaker said the appointments take effect from November 1.
