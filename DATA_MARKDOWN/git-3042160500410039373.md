The Cleveland Browns’ Jermaine Whitehead was let go by the team for tweeting a racial slur and issuing violent threats. And he’s since apologized for it.
Whitehead became angered after former NFL player and now Cleveland sports radio host Dustin Fox criticized how he played during the Browns’ 24-19 loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
The 26-year-old safety missed a bunch of tackles during the game and one resulted in a touchdown after a 75-yard catch.
“Whiteheads effort tackling today is a joke,” tweeted Fox on Sunday.
The newly ousted Brown responded shortly after the game while still in Denver’s visiting locker room.
“Come get it in blood b—- made ass lil boy. I’m out there with a broke hand .. don’t get smoked f–k ass cracker,” he tweeted.
And to another person who criticized his play Whitehead wrote: “Imma kill you b—-. that’s on blood.”
The safety’s Twitter account was suspended before he even left the locker room, and he was let go by the Browns on Monday morning.
“Jermaine Whitehead’s social media posts following today’s game were totally unacceptable and highly inappropriate,” wrote a Browns spokesman on Sunday.
Whitehead — or possibly his representative — took to Instagram the following day and said he was sorry for the tweets.
“🙏🏾 I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for my actions following our game with Denver,” he wrote. “That was totally out of character for me.”
“I do not justify my actions, but was extremely frustrated with the way I had played and our team losing because of it,” added Whitehead. “I was playing with a broken hand, but that is no excuse for my actions, and I am deeply regretful.”
The Auburn alum also didn’t seem to hold any hard feelings towards the Browns.
“My choice of words did not reflect who I am, but only what I was feeling,” he wrote. “Also, my sincerest apologies to my teammates, coaches, the Browns organization and most of all, the fans and kids that motivate me to even pursue this dream.”
“Again I am deeply sorry for my unacceptable behavior, and I wish the Browns the best of luck in the future,” added Whitehead.
Before the Browns, Whitehead played for the Green Bay Packers, the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers.
