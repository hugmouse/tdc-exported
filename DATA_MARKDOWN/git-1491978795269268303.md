        • Daniel Kindberg found guilty of funnelling public money to club • Östersund won Swedish Cup during Kindberg’s time in charge
      
A Swedish court has sentenced the man regarded as the mastermind behind the rise of the Swedish football team Östersund to three years in prison for serious financial crimes.
The Ångermanland court said on Tuesday that Daniel Kindberg was guilty of funnelling millions of kronor in taxpayer money into the club in a scheme that involved two other men and three companies, one being the Östersund municipality’s housing corporation for which Kindberg was chief executive.
When Kindberg was club chairman, Östersund rose from the amateur ranks in 2011 to Sweden’s top league in 2015 and won the Swedish Cup in 2017 under Graham Potter, who is now the manager of Brighton in the Premier League.
Östersund qualified for the Europa League, where the club advanced to the knockout stage before losing against Arsenal despite winning the second leg 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium.
