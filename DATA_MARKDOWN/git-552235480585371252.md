Councils are under pressure to cut the widespread use of a toxic chemical, which has been linked to cancer , in parks and on verges.
It comes after a Record investigation found just two of Scotland’s 32 local authorities have specific written policies to reduce the use of pesticide and herbicide on public land.
Other councils insisted they are making efforts to look at alternatives or limit applications.
Community groups have sprung up all over Scotland in an effort to stop councils drenching verges, paths and grass with chemicals and allow wild areas to flourish.
 
Most councils confirmed they use glyphosate, which is at the centre of multimillion-dollar cancer lawsuit in California.
Glyphosate, a legal ingredient used in Roundup, was banned in Austria in June. The Netherlands banned over-the-counter sales for home use.
In 2015, the World Health Organisation said the chemical probably causes cancer.
But a range of global chemical and food safety agencies concluded it is not carcinogenic when used as directed – and the EU approved its use in 2017 for five more years after a split vote.
The Scottish Greens yesterday raised concerns over children’s exposure to chemicals in public places.
Mark Ruskell MSP said: “These are places where our children should be free to play and come into contact with nature, without the worry of what chemical residues may be on the grass.
“We’re facing unprecedented loss of biodiversity in Scotland. Our parks and green spaces should be treated as havens for wildlife, not sprayed with broad-spectrum chemicals like glyphosate which kill off everything in their path.”
The Record asked all councils what chemicals they use and whether there are plans to move away from poisons.
Glasgow council is moving to “natural” weed killer and claimed to have cut use by half since 2004.
The city has trialled hot foam, steam, hot water and gas-powered burning.
In summer, the council began testing to “natural based” products.
South Lanarkshire said they used herbicide twice a year on all grass edges, obstacles, hard landscaping and borders.
Aberdeenshire council said they are exploring other methods including more street sweeping and steam treatments.
Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire are reviewing the use of Glyphosate, while Perth and Kinross said they’d consider “any reasonable alternatives”.
Edinburgh city council said “limits” were agreed in 2017, using the “least harmful” products.
Dundee council said it is reducing use of weedkiller, adding: “Examples of this are naturalised areas of grass, wildflower meadow planting and reduction of herbicide controls in shrub and planted areas.”
