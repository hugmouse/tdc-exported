Off the pitch, however, a number of stars of the Soweto giants can be seen driving fancy vehicles, and in particular, SUVs.
In the Bucs corner, defenders Happy Jele and Mthokozisi Dube can be seen driving around in a Lexus NX300 F Sport and a Range Rover Evoque, respectively. Both vehicles cost around the R800 000 mark.
Over at Chiefs, you'd find Khama Billiat is seemingly the SUV king at Naturena. The Zimbabwean star drives a Lumma Rover worth R2.5 million, while his fellow teammate George Maluleka owns a cool Jeep Rubicon priced at around R700 000.
