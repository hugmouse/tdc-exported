Weather experts have issued a yellow warning in parts of Scotland as heavy rain is expected to batter the country.
The Met Office put the warning into force from midnight on Monday, November 4, until 11.59pm later that evening.
It comes after the forecaster's prediction of downpours set to hit much of the east coast of the country during a 24-hour period.
Some homes and businesses in and around Edinburgh , Dundee, Perth, Montrose and Aberdeen could be flooded as a result of the weather.
 
Travel disruption is also anticipated in these areas, as some major bridges have issued restriction warnings due to the possibility of high winds.
A 40mph speed limit and a closure to double decker buses has been put into place on the Forth Road Bridge .
Drivers of double decker buses have also been told to avoid the Tay Road Bridge for much of Monday.
Officials and Cromarty, Dornoch and Kessock bridges have also issued out high wind cautions due to high winds.
A spokesperson for the Met Office said: “Further heavy rain may cause some flooding and disruption to travel.
“Spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer.
“Bus and train services may be affected with journey times taking longer.
“Flooding of a few homes and business is possible.”
