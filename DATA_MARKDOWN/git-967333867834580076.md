        If you enter a pet shop you can find not only food and leashes but also a great variety of pet accessories, including clothes. Some dogs, especially little ones, may need them on a frosty day but when it comes to golden retrievers this can only be for fun.
      
A video uploaded to Instagram lately shows a golden retriever puppy looking embarrassed after his owner put funny ducky pyjamas on him. The puppy tries to walk but stops now and then trying to understand why it feels so uncomfortable.
