        Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.
      
Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Descartes used to say: Do what you love and you’ll never work another day!
We closed the day, October 31 2019, at a price of $9,199. That’s a minor 0.03 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$2.87. It was the lowest closing price in five days.
We’re still 54 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).
Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $165,804,227,835. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.
Yesterday’s volume of $26,583,653,947 was the lowest in six days, 68 percent above the year’s average, and 41 percent below the year’s high.
A total of 290,619 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 13 percent below the year’s average and 35 percent below the year’s high.
Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.51. That’s $3.20 below the year’s high of $3.71.
As of now, there are 13,113 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.4 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.4 percent, and the top 1000 34.5 percent.
With a market capitalization of $166 Billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.
On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.
He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $127,186 by now, according to dickline.info.
Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Austria’s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.
Yesterday 20,869 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 12.1 percent above the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.
This was yesterday’s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:
