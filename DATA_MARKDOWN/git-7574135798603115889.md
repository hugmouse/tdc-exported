Florida death metal legends Obituary returned this year with the great new song “A Dying World,” and they’ve been touring like crazy. They already played NYC twice this year — once on their tour with Abbath, Midnight, and Devil Master and once at Thrasher x Vans Death Match — and now they’ve announced a December East Coast tour with False Prophet and Extinction A.D., which brings them back to NYC for two nights, and also includes shows in Asbury Park, Lancaster, Worcester, Richmond, Jacksonville, Savannah, and more. Making it even more exciting, they’ll be performing some classic albums in full.
The two-night NYC stand happens at Brooklyn’s Saint Vitus on December 12 & 13, and they’ll be performing their 1989 debut Slowly We Rot at night one and their 1990 sophomore LP Cause of Death at night two. Tickets for both shows go on sale Friday (11/8) at 10 AM.
The Asbury Park show happens December 10 at House of Independents and they’ll be performing Slowly We Rot at that one (tickets on sale Friday at 10 AM). All dates are listed on the tour poster below.
