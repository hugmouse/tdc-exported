Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was named AFC Player of the Week on Wednesday for his performance against the New England Patriots. 
Jackson scored three touchdowns — one through the air, two on the ground — en route to handing New England its first loss of the season. The victory helped put Jackson in the MVP conversation as the league’s first-ranked defense had trouble stopping the shifty quarterback.
This is the second time Jackson has won the award this season. He also earned the honor in a Week 1 win over the Miami Dolphins, when he threw five touchdowns. 
The Ravens are 6-2 in 2019, and sit atop the AFC North.
