THE Philippine Central Bank is done with easing monetary policy for this year after it cut interest rates three times and pumped liquidity into the banking system, Bangko Sentral Governor Benjamin Diokno said.
When asked if there would be no more reductions in the benchmark rate or reserve requirement ratio in 2019, Diokno said “absolutely.” Monetary authorities have done “more than enough” for the year, he said in a text message from his mobile phone.
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has lowered its policy rate by a total of 75 basis points this year and will bring down the reserve ratio to 14 percent by December from 18 percent in May. The Central Bank has two scheduled rate decisions for the rest of the year: next week and December 12.
The Central Bank has been loosening policy this year in the face of slowing inflation and a weakening economy. Data on Tuesday will probably show a further slowdown in inflation to 0.8 percent in October.
