Is there anything better than a pleasant surprise?A nice gift from a loved one, finding a few dirhams in the pocket of some clothes you haven’t worn in a while, we love it.Well Vox Cinemas is holding a mystery movie screening this week, offering cinema goers the chance to go along and watch a film without knowing what it is before it starts.The only clues we can see on the website is that the film has a running time of 130 minutes, is in English and is a PG15.Could it be a modern classic like The Dark Knight, Pulp Fiction, Goodfella or, Forrest Gump?Maybe it’s more of a classic like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Taxi Driver, Jaws, The Godfather or Apocalypse Now?No one knows, and that’s part of the fun.Vox Cinemas also recently screened six episodes of TV show Friends to celebrate the show’s 25th anniversary.But this time it’s a movie that will be shown so there’s not much chance of seeing Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey or Monica this time.Two screenings will take place this week, one in Abu Dhabi and another in Dubai, on Tuesday November 5.The screenings will take place at The Galleria Al Maryah Island in Abu Dhabi at 8pm and Mall of the Emirates in Dubai at 9pm.Standard tickets cost Dhs47.25, Premier tickets cost Dhs52.50 and they’re now on sale.We can’t wait to see what will be shown.From Dhs47.25. Abu Dhabi: Tues Nov 5 8pm onwards. The Galleria Al Maryah Island. Dubai: Tues Nov 5 9pm onwards. Mall of the Emirates, www.uaevoxcinemas.com.
