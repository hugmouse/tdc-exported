Opposing privatisation of Air India, an airline pilots' union has threatened to go on strike unless their long pending demands related to salaries are addressed, according to a communication.
The nearly 800-member strong Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), whose members fly narrow-body planes, has decided to work towards bringing all the unions at the airline under a common platform to oppose privatisation of the airline.
The government is working on the final contours of disinvestment of loss-making Air India, which has a debt worth over Rs 58,000 crore.
