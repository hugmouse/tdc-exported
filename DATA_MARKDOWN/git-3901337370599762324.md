Maritzburg United shot-stopper Richard Ofori says picking up a point against Orlando Pirates felt the same as getting a win.

Ofori played a starring role as the Team of Choice denied the Buccaneers victory in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday evening.
"It's a vert good result because we knew the game is gonna be tough because after [Orlando Pirates] losing against Chiefs I know definitely they will come, they will come hard on us, we know. To pick a point here I think it's a win," the Ghanaian international goalkeeper said on SuperSport TV after receiving his Man of the Match accolade.
"It's normal because once you're playing against Orlando Pirates here, definitely as a goalkeeper you need to stand out, that's what I did, so I will thank my players because they did very well, we defended the goal very well, so I'll say this [award] is for all of us."
Ofori did not want to be drawn into arguments of whether Justin Shonga's strike that hit the underside of the crossbar, actually crossed the line or not.
"I can't say much about it, but what I know is that the most important thing we picked a draw here, that's the most important thing and we know, we need to keep on pushing, make our fans and the Maritzburg city happy," he added.
