An arson attack on a property in west Belfast using fireworks could have ended in tragedy, police have warned.
Fireworks were used to ignite a bin bag full of waste at a property in the Rossnareen Road area in the early hours of Monday.
A PSNI spokesman said officers received a report at 2.40am of a blaze in the stairwell of the property.
Firefighters attended and extinguished the flames.
Inspector James Murphy said it was lucky no-one had been killed or injured in the incident.
"This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable," he said.
"Everyone should be able to feel safe in their homes and not feel afraid by the reckless behaviour of others.
"Throwing fireworks at anything or anyone is irresponsible and it is important to remember they are made from explosive material and, if misused, can cause serious and life-changing injuries.
"This reckless action could have resulted in something more serious and we are lucky not to be dealing with a tragic incident.
"Enquiries are continuing and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 106 of 04/11/19."
