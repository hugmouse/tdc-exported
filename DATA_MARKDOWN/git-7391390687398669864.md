Somehow, 2019 is almost over and the holiday season is nearly here. More importantly, this is also the season when a lot of highly anticipated movies and awards contenders come out. If you're someone who likes to chase your stuffing and pumpkin pie with a trip to the theater, you'll want to know which movies are coming out this Thanksgiving, so you have your post-dinner plans in place.
To be clear, these are not movies about Thanksgiving, but rather movies that hit cinemas at this magical time of year... a time of year that's full of both food and chances to say things like, "I think she'll at least get a nomination."
Now, depending on who you're going to the movies with, deciding which film you're going to see could be simple or complicated. Need to take your nieces and nephews out? Frozen 2 will be a better pick than Doctor Sleep. Going with a few hometown friends? The options are more wide open. Want to be by yourself at cry for a while? Tom Hanks just so happens to be playing Mister Rogers.
Whether you celebrate Thanksgiving or not — or need to flee annoying family members or not — here are 12 movies you can choose from for all your end of November viewing needs.
