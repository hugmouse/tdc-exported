Hot on the heels of its footlong vegan sausage roll, Morrisons unveils its vegan pork pie, available from December 9.
The pie's recipe is apparently a closely guarded secret that was only known by six staff members. It supposedly tastes meaty, and is pretty close to the real thing, but that's coming from a vegan website, so who knows how accurate that is.
"So many people across the UK are fond of eating a pork pie at Christmas," said Morrisons pie buyer, Steven Halford. "Our vegan and vegetarian customers previously couldn’t enjoy a pork pie but with our new meat free product they can enjoy a great tasting alternative."
The pies will be rolling out at the supermarket's pie shop counters from December 9, priced at £1.75, or - if you think they'll be so tasty you'll be coming back for more - two for £3.
Now all we need is for Morrisons to launch a whole vegan turkey and we'll be set for Christmas.
