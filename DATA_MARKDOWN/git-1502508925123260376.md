Chinese handset maker Realme on Tuesday announced the millennials by selling 5.2 million smartphones during four rounds of the "Realme festive days" sale between September 30-October 31.
With a growth of 160 per cent since last year, the smartphone player became the top-selling smartphone brand on Flipkart during the festive season.
"Our 5.2 million smartphone sales figure is an actual and credible sell-out data which is different from the usual sell-in numbers, which the other brands have been promoting. Realme offers the products which are high on features, style, and performance and is available across price segments," Madhav Sheth, CEO, Realme India, said in a statement.
