Han Ye Seul's thoughts on public dating have made headlines and gone trending on Korean news sites. She appeared on MBC's 'Unni's Salon' where she talked about love and dating, saying: "I've never fallen in love with someone at first sight.

Netizens have been commenting, saying: 

        "At this age, she's saying she wants to get married.""She's gorgeous though."
