19-year-old Njabulo Blom is fast establishing himself as a bright future prospect in a star-studded Kaizer Chiefs side.
Off the field, the soft-spoken starlet personifies the definition of drip. Check out some of his best looks.
Blom is one of a few fledglings who have staked a claim at Amakhosi. The likes of Happy Mashiane, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Bruce Bvuma can all be added to that list.

However, it is Blom whose star has shone brightest since making his first appearance and the right fullback has deputised excellently in the absence of Reeve Frosler.
Off the field, the Dobsonville-born defender is a swaggy person who looks comfortable in his outfits. While he is no poster boy as yet, there is no doubt that the young Blom is well on his way to becoming a hit.
Check out some of his best looks in the gallery above.

        Do you think Blom can go on to be a regular starter for Kaizer Chiefs in the near future?
