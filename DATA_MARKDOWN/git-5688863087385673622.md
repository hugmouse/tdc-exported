        World Champion and No.6 ranked PV Sindhu crashed out in the opening round of the China Open in Fozhou after suffering a shock defeat to lower-ranked Pai Yu Po of Chinese Taipei. Meanwhile, the doubles duo of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Ashwini Ponnappa won their first-round clash.
      
Sindhu added one more to her list of early exits in tournaments after China, Korea, and Denmark, with a three-game loss to World No.42 Pai. Although she rallied back from losing the first game 13-21 to win the second 21-18, she was eventually edged out 21-19 in the third to end a 74-minute contest. Just last month, Sindhu had suffered a quarter-final loss to eventual winner An Se Young at the French Open. 
Over in the men’s singles category, Prannoy, who was making a comeback after recovering from dengue, lost his opening round contest to Rasmus Gemke of Denmark in straight games. The score read 17-21, 18-21.
The only good news for India on Tuesday came from the mixed doubles event, with Satwik and Ashwini progressing. Although ranked 30th in the world, they got the better of Joshua Hurlburt-Yu and Josephine Wu of Canada 21-19, 21-19 to move into the next round in the mixed doubles competition.
