KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): Worldwide sales of semiconductors rose 8.2% quarter-on-quarter to US$106.7 billion during the third quarter of 2019 (3Q19), according to the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).
In a statement on its website Nov 1, SIA, however, said the figure was 14.6% less than the third quarter of 2018.
It said global sales for the month of September 2019 reached US$35.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% over August's total and 14.6% less than sales from September 2018.
All monthly sales numbers are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organisation and represent a three-month moving average.
SIA president and CEO John Neuffer said following months of slower sales earlier in the year, the global semiconductor market rebounded somewhat in 3Q19.
"While sales remain well behind the record totals from last year, month-to-month sales increased for the third consecutive month in September and were up across all major product categories.
"Month-to-month sales also increased across all regional markets, with China and the Americas leading the way," he said.
SIA said that regionally, sales increased compared to August 2019 in China (4.4%), the Americas (4.3%), Europe (2.9%), Asia Pacific/All Other (2.4%), and Japan (1.2%).
It said sales were down across all regions compared to September 2018: Europe (-6.4%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-6.9%), Japan (-10.0%), China (-12.9%), and the Americas (-30.4%).
