ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - Georgia has continued to boost its nonconference schedule by agreeing to a home-and-home series with Ohio State for 2030 and 2031.
The currently sixth-ranked Bulldogs (No. 6 in the College Football Playoff ) will play a home game against the Buckeyes on Sept. 14, 2030, and travel to No. 3 Ohio State (No. 1 CFP) on Aug. 30, 2031.
In the teams’ only meeting, Georgia beat Ohio State 21-14 in the Citrus Bowl following the 1992 season.
Earlier this year, Georgia announced games against Oklahoma in 2023 and 2031.
Last year, Georgia announced a home-and-home series against Clemson in 2029 and 2030. The teams also will play in the 2024 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game in Atlanta.
Georgia also has scheduled games against UCLA in 2025 and 2026, Florida State in 2027 and 2028 and Texas in 2028 and 2029.
