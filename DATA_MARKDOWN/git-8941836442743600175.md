Here’s your look at highlights from the weekly AP photo report, a gallery featuring a mix of front-page photography, the odd image you might have missed and lasting moments our editors think you should see.
This week’s gallery includes a man comforting his horse as wildfires break out in the Simi Valley area of California; a demonstrator running through the spray of a police water cannon during anti-government protests in Chile; and Halloween celebrations in Germany.
This gallery contains photos from the week of Oct. 26-Nov. 1, 2019.
