The new school will open up in August of 2021 in the Gateway Area, on Griffin Drive south of State Road 82.
The school board meeting begins at 6 p.m.
The county will also vote on pre-construction budgets for two other new schools, both in the Estero area. One is an elementary school, the other is a middle school.
The county is set to spend about $7 million combined on those two projects.
