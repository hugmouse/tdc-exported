The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 16.29 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal, Birla Corporation said in a regulatory filing.
Amid a slowdown in the core sector, the company said it has been able to grow its net profit helped by multiple factors, including higher realisation from sale of premium and blended cement and cost rationalisation.
