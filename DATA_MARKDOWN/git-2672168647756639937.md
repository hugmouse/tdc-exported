The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation has extended the period of drawing an environmental management plan (EMP) for factories operating under the nine prioritized industrial sectors.
The EMP drafting period was already announced on January 10, 2018 with Notification No.03/2018.
As per the notification, those factories that have yet to draw EMPs are to draw and submit them within six months after this notification issued on July 29, 2019.
Action will be taken against those factories that fail to do so in accord with the existing factory laws, rules and procedures or Sector 32 of the environmental conservation law.
The nine prioritized industrial sectors include alcohol, beer and beverage, pesticides, cement and lime, textile and dyeing, metal casting and purification, steel production, blacksmithing, rubber, pulp and paper and sugar production.
