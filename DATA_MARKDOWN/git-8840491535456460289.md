WORK is taking place on the provision of a new pedestrian crossings at three busy Mayo locations.
The first is being constructed at Lannagh Road in Castlebar between Mayo Peace Park and the Ellison Hotel.
Welcoming the new, Councillor Ger Deere said: ”Fair play to Mayo County Council for dealing with this quickly.
“It is a very busy road and the crossing is badly needed for those using Lough Lannagh Holiday Village, Mayo Peace Park and Garden of Remembrance, the new swimming pool and leisure complex at Lough Lannagh, Castlebar Tennis Club, the new 1st Mayo Scouts Den and other community amenities.”
Councillor Deere also also welcomed the linking of the Lough Lannagh amenity to the town with a pedestrian crossing being installed near the bridge at St. Gerald's College, Castlebar.
“It is vital for the busy roads there. Also, hats off to Mick O Malley Contractors and his crew for the rapid work being done on behalf of Mayo County Council at the pedestrian crossing at Davitt College,” he added.
