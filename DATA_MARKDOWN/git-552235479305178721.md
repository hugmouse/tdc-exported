Social media can spot a hoax a mile off and Stenhousemuir were caught trying to give their hospitality suite a suspicious makeover earlier this week.
Ochilview and Old Trafford have their own distinct charms but it'd take a master of disguise to combine the two into one image and get away with it.
Stenny tried boldly to meld Manchester United 's luxury lounge with their own hallowed turf visible through a window in the background.
Of course, this could have been a marketing ploy, with the intention all along to get caught, but it didn't stop Falkirk putting the digital boot in.
Their Lowland rivals took to Twitter to show off an "upgrade" of their own.
But as you can see from the image below, something's not quite right. Namely, the massive Manchester City crest lurking in the corner.
Stenny blasted back by reminding the Bairns what happened the last time the two collided at Ochilview - a 4-2 victory for the home side in the 2018 Scottish Cup.
Certainly, what the lower leagues lack in glamour, they more than make up for in patter.
