Deepika Padukone might have opted for a quite Diwali this year with hubby Ranveer Singh but she is currently gearing up to entertain her fans on the silver screen as she has interesting films in the pipeline.
The diva, who is all set to essay the role of Draupadi in the upcoming feature 'Mahabharat' will also be producing the project along with Madhu Mantena. The film which is reported to release in multiple parts is said to clash with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Baiju Bawra' at the box office on Diwali 2021.
Deepika's professional life has been keeping her quite busy but the 'Padmaavat' actress was spotted in Mumbai today. But what grabbed our attention was that the diva seemed to be in no mood to get clicked as she headed right inside without even looking at the shutterbugs who were trying to click her.
Meanwhile, the mesmerising diva will soon be seen in Meghna Gulzar's 'Chhapaak', a film based on an acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. The film will release in January 2020. Apart from that, she is collaborating with her husband Ranveer Singh for the first time after their marriage for Kabir Khan's sports drama titled '83'.
