OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal cabinet will be briefing an influential American lawmaker Wednesday on Canada's work with Mexico to ease Democrats' doubts over ratifying the new North American free trade deal.
Richard Neal, the chair of the U.S. House of Representatives ways and means committee, is a key player in bringing ratification of the new trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to the floor of Congress for final legal approval.
Labour Minister Patty Hajdu will join an expanded meeting between Neal, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to provide an update on how Canada is trying to help Mexico comply with a key NAFTA provision -- ensuring that measures to improve workers' rights in Mexico are enforceable, officials say.
For several months, the Democrats have been trying to negotiate changes with Trump's trade czar, Robert Lighthizer, to the NAFTA's provisions on labour, environment, patent protection for drugs and enforcement, and have, by all accounts, worked hard to make progress.
During the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada and the U.S. pushed Mexico to improve its labour standards to prevent companies in the manufacturing and auto sectors from relocating to a market where workers earn far less. Now, the Americans want to make sure those changes have teeth.
Hajdu travelled to Mexico this summer to share Canada's expertise on improving Mexican labour standards, and Neal paid his own visit to Mexico last month.
