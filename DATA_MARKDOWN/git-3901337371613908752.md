The Amakhosi's head honcho is revered around the country for his work both on and off the field, as he went from a player to a club owner in the 1960s and 1970s, and this year is a big one for both him and the club that he formed as he celebrated his 75th birthday earlier in the month and the Glamour Boys reach their half-century in January.
Chiefs and their Chairman were flooded with messages from former players, politicians and fans, and now he's had something to say in return...
In part, speaking to Chiefs' social media team, Motaung said, “I wish to take this opportunity here now to express my sincere thanks for all those messages that I received from the Kgosi family, and soccer fraternity at large.
“And also, I wish to say to the Kgosi family that we are always committed to ensuring that we take this brand to greater heights and we continue to keep it as a great brand in our history.
“I was very much humbled to see so many interesting and very good messages that were posted and came to me directly.”

November could be a defining month for the table-topping Amakhosi as they look to extend their lead at the top of the Absa Premiership while also progressing in the Telkom Knockout, starting with this weekend's clash with Orlando Pirates.
