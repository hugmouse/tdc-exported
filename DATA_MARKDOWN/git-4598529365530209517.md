As President Donald Trump’s team braces for public impeachment inquiry testimonies beginning next week, they’ve focused much of their trepidation on the first witness in particular: Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor.
According to CNN, the White House is wary of the combination of Taylor’s credibility — longtime and current State Department official, veteran, personally recruited by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — and the damning information he first conveyed behind closed doors.
Trump is so anxious about the upcoming testimony that he barked at Pompeo for hiring Taylor in the first place, a rare rebuke for one of Trump’s preferred secretaries.
Taylor’s closed-door testimony was one of the most damning days for Trump during the impeachment inquiry so far, as he detailed the quid pro quo at the heart of the Ukraine pressure campaign.
