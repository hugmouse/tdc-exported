        Carlos Sainz had another solid race at the US Grand Prix and has made a habit of finishing in the points this season. The McLaren driver has really impressed this season and has performed so well that his 8th place may even be a little bit disappointing. 
      
“It was a good day’s work for the team," Sainz said in his race debrief. "We managed to bring home a couple of points finishes and a good ten points in the bag, so congratulations to everyone. For me, personally, I feel we could’ve achieved more, but my race was compromised at the start after I got hit into Turn One.

        “Stopping for the Hard tyre and going for one-stop meant I did a very long second stint. The pace was decent and we managed to secure an important P8. All in all a positive weekend and we move on to Brazil aiming for more.”
      
Sainz did well to get into the points after the racing incident with Alex Albon damaged his car. He will hope to perform well next time out in Brazil and continue to impress.
