Britain’s female lawmakers have addressed a letter to the Duchess of Sussex in which they expressed their support to her against the media scrutiny.Over 70 female MPs signed an open letter to express their solidarity with Markle against "the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in our national newspapers concerning you, your character and your family."The letter also reads that some stories about Meghan contain "outdated, colonial undertones."The MPs also wrote: "With this in mind we expect the national media to have the integrity to know when a story is in the national interest and when it is seeking to tear a woman down for no apparent reason."Meghan, 38, opened up about going through a "difficult time" in order to deal with media scrutiny over the past two years.The Duchess of Sussex talked about a lot of pressure she and her husband Prince Harry are facing because of the growing media attention.In an ITV documentary, Megan talked about the intolerable pressure caused by the non-stop spotlights. "She had no idea how much pressure she would face when she became a member of the royal family," she said.Meghan married Prince Harry, 35, in May 2018, and gave birth to their first child Archie in May.
