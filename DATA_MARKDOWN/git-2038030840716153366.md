Cape Town – Jennifer Hudson is every bit the Queen of Soul in scenes for the upcoming Aretha Franklin biopic.
Filming for the movie kicked off in Georgia in September.
The Academy Award-winning actress was pictured on set in New York on Saturday with co-star Marlon Wayans, who will play the singer's first husband, Ted White.
The upcoming film titled Respect will reportedly centre on her rise to fame from singing as a child in her father's choir to becoming a music superstar.
South Africa and Tony award-winner Liesl Tommy makes her big screen directorial debut.
Other cast members include Forest Whitaker, Audra McDonald, Mary J. Blige and Tituss Burgess.
In the pictures, Jennifer is seen sitting in a blue Cadillac alongside Marlon.
According to the DailyMail, the scene is reportedly set in 1966 and sees Marlon collecting money from a group of prostitutes while Jennifer sits in the passenger seat waiting for him to return.
