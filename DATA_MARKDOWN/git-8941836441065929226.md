SEATTLE (AP) - Russell Wilson hit Jacob Hollister on a 10-yard touchdown on the opening possession of overtime, and the Seattle Seahawks rallied for a 40-34 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
Wilson continued his brilliant season, tying his career high with five touchdown passes as Seattle (7-2) overcame Jason Myers’ missed 40-yard field-goal attempt on the final play of regulation and never gave Tampa Bay a chance in the extra session. Wilson was 5 of 8 for 70 yards in overtime, capping the winning drive by hitting the reserve tight end across the middle for his second touchdown of the game.
Wilson finished 29 of 43 for 378 yards. It was his third career game with five TD passes and capped Seattle’s wild second half after trailing 21-7 midway through the second quarter.
Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston was nearly Wilson’s equal throwing for 335 yards and two touchdowns. Winston led Tampa Bay (2-6) to a tying score in the final minute of regulation on Dare Ogunbowale’s 1-yard run, but never got his hands on the ball in overtime.
Winston was 29 of 44 passing, but unlike Wilson had one very costly turnover in the fourth quarter that led to a key field goal for Seattle.
Mike Evans and Tyler Lockett both had huge games as the primary targets for their respective quarterbacks. Lockett had a career-high 13 catches for 152 yards and two touchdowns. Evans was just as good with 12 catches for 180 yards and one score. But the difference was the contribution from Seattle’s supporting cast of DK Metcalf and Hollister. Metcalf had a 53-yard touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter and had a key 29-yard completion in overtime that moved Seattle inside the Tampa Bay 10. Metcalf finished with six catches for 123 yards.
Hollister had a 1-yard TD catch in the first half, then made the biggest catch of his brief Seattle career. He flashed across the middle and barely got the ball across the goal line to set off a wild celebration.
Ogunbowale’s TD run with 48 seconds left pulled Tampa Bay within 34-33 and rather than going for the 2-point conversion, Bucs coach Bruce Arians opted to play for overtime with the extra point. He almost didn’t get there as Wilson quickly drove Seattle into field-goal range. Myers missed wide left from 47 yards at the same end of the stadium in the first half and pushed the 40-yard attempt to the right on the last play. Myers is just 3 of 8 this season on kicks of 40 or more yards.
While the kicking problems are a concern for Seattle, it became a moot point. Seattle won the coin toss and Wilson went to work, with his throw to Metcalf for 29 yards on third-and-6 the best play of the extra session.
TOPPING 100
Seattle running back Chris Carson rushed for 105 yards, the first running back this year to top 100 yards against Tampa Bay’s league-best run defense. Seattle finished with 145 yards rushing as a team.
INJURIES
Tampa Bay lost a pair of starters and a key reserve in the first half. Cornerback Carlton Davis suffered a hip injury on Seattle’s opening drive and did not return. Outside linebacker Carl Nassib was lost early in the second quarter because of a groin injury and Nassib’s backup, Anthony Nelson, injured his hamstring in the second quarter and was immediately ruled out.
