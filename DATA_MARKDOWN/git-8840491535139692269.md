A VOTE of confidence has been passed in Mayo GAA County Board.
The endorsement was given by club delegates at last night's behind-closed-doors meeting of the organisation at Elverys MacHale Park in Castlebar.
The meeting was called to discuss a number of controversial issues raised by the Mayo International GAA Supporters Foundation, headed by millionaire backer Tim O'Leary.
The foundation is withholding a sum of €250,000 raised for Mayo football in New York last May after citing concerns in relation to governance issues.
In a statement following the meeting, the board confirmed its stance in refraining from public comment on the matter due to legal reasons.
The adoption of a vote of confidence in the board strengthens its position in dealing with an issue that has attracted much adverse publicity in recent weeks.
However, it remains to be seen how a resolution will be found other than the legal route.
