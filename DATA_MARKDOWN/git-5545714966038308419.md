Speaking in an interview with Famitsu, Masayoshi Yokoyama revealed that a demo will be released for Sega's upcoming strategy RPG Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which is currently in development for PS4.The demo will let players try out first-hand the wild new real-time-strategy battle mechanics, making their debut in the now legendary adventure series. Yokoyama noted that the demo build would be an upgrade from any version of Like a Dragon currently used in previous gameplay trailers, but no actual date for its arrival was announced.As an aside, a new "job" was revealed for one of Like a Dragon's protagonists. "Office Worker" is a job attainable by female lead Saeko Mukouda, (portrayed by contest winner Eri Kamataki). Upon securing the role, this job will allow her to battle with her enemies using office supplies, which sounds like a riot. The Like a Dragon job system opens up skills and abilities to characters once they have acquired the job in question, via stat-building and entrance exams.Yakuza: Like a Dragon launches on PS4 in Japan January 16, and will head west later in 2020.Yakuza: Like a Dragon demo announced [Famitsu / Gematsu]
