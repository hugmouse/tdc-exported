Famitsu's Japanese chart figures are now in for 28th October - 3rd November, revealing that Luigi's Mansion 3 couldn't quite make it to the top spot.
The game sold more than 150,000 copies in its opening week, but even that total couldn't defeat Persona 5 Royal which claimed just over 200,000 sales on PS4. Ring Fit Adventure is still performing nicely, too, managing to stay close to the top in third position, and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 has debuted in fifth.
