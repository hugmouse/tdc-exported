Will Aldi’s holiday commercial be the greatest show among them all this year? The supermarket has just unveiled its Christmas ad for UK viewers, and it’s jam-packed with action and pop culture influences comprising references to the BBC’s Peaky Blinders, The Greatest Showman, and A Christmas Carol. Set to Robbie Williams’ Let Me Entertain You, the short starts with Aldi’s protagonist Kevin the Carrot in trouble. He’s being held hostage and bound to a grater by a cap-wearing gang of Brussels sprouts called the Leafy Blinders. “Because Christmas before Kevin was all about sprouts,” the narrator explains.
