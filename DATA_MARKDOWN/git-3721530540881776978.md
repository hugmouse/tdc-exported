The Outer Worlds is coming to Nintendo Switch in early 2020, according to an investor call earlier today.
The Outer Worlds publisher Private Division, a subsidiary of Take Two Interactive, announced the game will be released on Nintendo Switch during its 2020 fiscal year, which means that the game will drop before March 31, 2020, when the fiscal year ends.
The game was already announced for the Switch earlier this year, but this helps narrow down the release timing. The Outer Worlds released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC on Oct. 25.
The Outer Worlds is the latest game by Obsidian Entertainment, the company behind Fallout: New Vegas. In the short time since the game was released, it’s managed to draw attention to great NPCs and also fit the playstyle of a wide variety of players. The Outer Worlds will be a good addition to the Nintendo Switch library and should satisfy the itch of any RPG fans who have yet to get their hands on the game.
