President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to welcome the Rugby World Cup champion Springboks at the Union Buildings in Arcadia, Pretoria, on Thursday.
The visit to the capital city will mark the start of the Springboks' national parade of the Webb Ellis Cup. 
Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko said the public were welcome to head out to Government Avenue to witness the event and catch a glimpse of the famous trophy, which South Africa has secured for the third time since 1995.  
The team landed at OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday and were overwhelmingly welcomed by thousands of supporters who were clad in their green and gold Springbok caps and T-shirts, while some proudly waved the national flag. 
The Boks have not only come back from the World Cup triumphant, but have also been named World Rugby's Team of the Year while coach Rassie Erasmus garnered Coach of the Year, and flank Pieter-Steph du Toit got Player of the Year.
The president is expected to receive the Springboks from 07:00 for an hour, while the parade will start from 10:00 to 11:00, entering Tshwane via the N4, before moving to Johannesburg and Soweto later in the day.
