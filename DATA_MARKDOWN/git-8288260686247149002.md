Coleen Nolan has spoken out over her life as a child - where she would heartbreakingly 'dread' her drunk father returning home.
Coleen, a Loose Women star, told the panel about the painful chapter in her life.
The youngest of the Nolan sisters chatted during a segment called Life Before Loose on the ITV chat show today (Tuesday, November 5).
She spoke out, breaking her silence as she bravely admitted to being terrified of her dad Tommy.
Coleen lived in fear of her father coming home on a Saturday evening and 'starting an argument' with her late mum Maureen.
In 2008 her sister Anne went public about being sexually abused by her dad in her autobiography Anne's Song.
Speaking on Loose Women Coleen said: "He never drank during the day. He wasn't a from when he got up type of drinker.
"When he went out, and certainly to the clubs because he was really, really popular and everybody loved my dad, he used to drink brandy.
"I loved him until he’d had too much to drink and then I found him scary. Because he was quite argumentative when he was drunk.
 
"On a Saturday I used to have that dread of seven or eight o'clock thinking 'oh he'll be home soon' because I'd know he'd come in looking for an argument with my mum."
Coleen, 54, says to this day she has 'drink phobia'.
