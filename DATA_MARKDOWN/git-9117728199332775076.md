        The main aim of the 2021 regulation overhaul is to make F1 racing more exciting by allowing closer racing and produce a result which would see teams outside of Mercedes, Aston Martin Red Bull Racing and Ferrari on the podium. However, Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto is confident the top teams will keep their advantage. 
      
A budget cap of $175m will be implemented which cuts down spending for the big three teams. A lot of the midfield teams don't spend that much now. Next year, the big teams will be able to build and focus on their 2021 car without the budget cap limitations. 
"I think when you are talking about completely different regulations, for the big teams it will be an advantage. I am pretty sure that in 2021 we will still have gaps that are quite big," Binotto said in bosses' press conference. 

        "It will be very hard to reduce everything from 2021. In Italy we have laws about employees that are a little different, so reducing for us will not be easy."
