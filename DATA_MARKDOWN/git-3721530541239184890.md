Regirock is yet another un-useful Pokémon in Pokémon Go, but it’s a necessary part for those participating in the Colossal Discovery event, as well as those who are just trying to complete their Pokédex.
Regirock is weak against water-, grass-, ground-, steel- and fighting-type moves, so there are a whole lot of counters you can use against this thing. Check out some of the following below:
You can whip out any Community Day starter Pokémon, except fire-types, in this situation, too. Time to dust off that Hydro Cannon Swampert. Just don’t take fire-, ice-, flying-, or bug-type Pokémon.
Lucky players may encounter a Shiny Regiock. Do note that if you do see a Shiny, it will catch on the first ball you hit it with, so use a Pinap Berry to score some extra candy. Regirock’s Shiny is cool because he turns into a chunk of caramel chocolate.
Once you nab your Regirock, give it Rock Throw and Stone Edge for it make the most of its rock-typing, but do note that Regirock is not that great of an attacker.
Regirock will leave raids with its siblings on Nov. 4 at 4 p.m. ET.
