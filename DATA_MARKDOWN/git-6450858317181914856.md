While the concept of smart doorbells would’ve been laughed at 10 years ago, there are plenty of smart camera- and voice-enabled doorbells on the market in 2019 – so many, in fact, that it can be pretty hard to choose between them. They’re generally not that cheap, granted, but retailers do offer discounts from time to time that makes them a little more tempting.
But which deals are the best? Using our expert knowledge, we’ve scoured the web for the latest and greatest smart doorbell deals available right now for the likes of Ring, Nest, Netatmo and even a couple that you might not have heard of.
Some of the best retailers to check out for smart doorbells in the UK include Amazon, Currys PC World, eBuyer and Argos, although with Black Friday 2019 fast approaching, we expect this list to expand in the coming weeks.

When it comes to Ring, arguably the main provider of smart doorbells in the UK, the prices can vary quite a bit. The most popular of the range is the Ring Video Doorbell 2, offering 1080p HD video, two-way chat and integration with Amazon Alexa. It tends to retail at around £179, so anything cheaper than £150 is a deal worth considering.

Those who want something a little more premium can opt for the Ring Video Doorbell Pro at £229, offering higher quality video playback in a more attractive design than the standard model. These deals are usually harder to come by, but we expect them to appear in the run-up to Black Friday 2019 later this month.
You’ve also got the Ring Door View Cam, a smart doorbell that connects to your viewfinder. It’s the same price as the second-gen Video Doorbell at £179, although we haven’t seen many discounts just yet because it’s still relatively new – it only launched in June 2019.
Ring aside, you’ve got similar options available from the likes of Nest and Netatmo.
Like the Doorbell Pro, the Nest Hello is one of the more expensive smart doorbells on the market with an RRP of £229, but it offers high-quality HDR video, Google Assistant integration and advanced features like facial recognition, 24/7 recording and more via the Nest Hello monthly subscription.
The good news is that the Nest Hello has been out for a while and is often discounted at retailers. We’ve seen deals for around the £200 mark, so anything cheaper is a steal.
It’s worth pointing out that while the likes of Ring and Nest produce the most popular smart doorbells, there are plenty of other manufacturers offering similar products at much cheaper price points. These may tend to be a little rough around the edges, especially in terms of companion apps, but it’s a route worth considering if smart doorbells are generally out of your price range.
Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that these deals are usually only around for a few days, so if you do see a smart doorbell deal that tempts you, we’d recommend buying it sooner rather than later.
