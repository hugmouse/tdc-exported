Lakers guard Avery Bradley has been ruled out for Los Angeles' game against Chicago because of a lower right leg contusion.
Bradley got hurt during Sunday's 103-96 victory at San Antonio. He is averaging 10.7 points in six games in his first season with the Lakers.
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replaced Bradley in the starting lineup Tuesday night.
The Lakers also were without Rajon Rondo, who is coming back from a right calf injury. He has yet to play this season.
