KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): London Biscuits Bhd has defaulted on principal payments to seven banks, amounting to a total of RM89.19 million.

London Biscuits attributed the default in payments to cashflow constraints, with the default dates between June 19 and Sept 20, 2019.
“The Company is currently assessing the significant impact of the default in payment on the business, financial and operations of the remaining business of the Group,” the biscuit manufacturer, which shares tanked to as low as five sen in the last one month, said.
The company fell into Practice Note 17 status on July 9, but remains asset rich.
As at June 30, 2019, its total assets amounted to RM812.48 million, translating to a net asset value per share of RM1.28.
