Cross-border usage of China's yuan currency exceeded 14 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) during the January-September period, up 20% from a year earlier, a central bank official said on Wednesday.
About 6 trillion yuan of cross-border yuan payment was for securities investment, thanks to China's accelerated opening of its capital markets, Huo Yingli, director of macroprudential policy bureau at the People's Bank of China told a conference in Shanghai.
She added that yuan-denominated assets remain attractive, forecasting continuous foreign money inflows.Special Thursday Expiry on 10th 7th NovEarly Closure to The Great Diwali Discount. Last Chance to get Moneycontrol PRO for a year @ Rs. 289/- only Coupon code: DIWALI
