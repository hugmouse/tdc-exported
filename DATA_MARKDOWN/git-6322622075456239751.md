KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Affin Hwang Capital' group managing director Datuk Maimoonah Hussain will retire effective Nov 3 after serving the group for more than 12 years.
She had served seven years as managing director of Affin Investment Bank Bhd and five years in her current post at Affin Hwang Capital since the successful completion of the merger between Affin Investment Bank Bhd and HwangDBS Investment Bank Bhd in Nov 2014.
Maimoonah was the pivotal figurehead of the complex merger process and the bank’s success today was a testament to her leadership, said Affin Hwang in a statement today.
Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd chairman Abdul Malik Rahman said under Maimoonah’s guidance and leadership, Affin Hwang Capital had built a strong foundation for growth, and the bank was well positioned as one of the leading investment banks in the country, with the right strategy and people culture to drive innovation, accelerate sales growth and enhance profitability.
