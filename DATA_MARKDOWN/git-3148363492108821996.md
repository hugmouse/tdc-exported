He was speaking in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who is running for re-election after a staunch pro-Second Amendment first term
Bevin’s pro-Second Amendment accomplishments include supporting and signing legislation to abolish the requirement that Kentuckians acquire a concealed carry license before carrying a gun for self-defense. Breitbart News reported that Bevin signed the permitless carry legislation on March 11.
Trump used the Lexington, Kentucky, rally to warn that Bevin’s opponent, Democrat Andy Beshear, cannot be trusted to defend the Second Amendment.
He talked of Democrat plans to target the Second Amendment, saying, “And that includes the gentleman that is running against [Bevin], they are after your Second Amendment. We can’t let that happen.”
