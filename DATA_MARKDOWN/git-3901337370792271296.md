Rooney's two-season spell with MLS team DC United came to an end last month, when the US club were defeated in the play-offs by Canadian team Toronto FC, and the 34-year-old will now sign for Derby County when the transfer window opens in January.  
According to the Daily Mail, England's all-time leading goalscorer has already reported for training with the Championship side ahead of his 18-month deal as he looks to familiarise himself with the club ahead of his official move.

As part of Rooney's deal with Derby, the former Three Lions captain will earn about £100 000 (R1.9 million) a week and will also take up a coaching role at Pride Park in preparation for a new career in football once he hangs up his boots.
The Liverpool-born forward returns to England, where he previously spent 16 seasons with the Toffees and the Red Devils and became the latter club's all-time leading goalscorer with 253 goals to his name.
