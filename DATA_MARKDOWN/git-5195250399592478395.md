Hero MotoCorp announced only yesterday that it would be introducing its first BSVI compliant model in the Indian market and it did not come as a surprise considering that we are less than five months away from the stringent emission standards coming into effect across the board.
The largest two-wheeler manufacturer had revealed earlier in the year that the Splendor iSmart had become the first motorcycle in India to receive BSVI certification. Now, it has been launched in India with a price tag Rs. 8,000 costlier than the outgoing Splendor iSmart at Rs. 64,900.  
The BSVI Splendor iSmart gets a slightly bigger engine – 113.2 cc compared to the 109.15cc engine of the outgoing version with fuel-injection technology. The powertrain appears to have been redesigned. The increase in engine cubic capacity did not up the power output though as it is in fact down from 9.5 hp to 9.1 hp at 7,500 rpm.
