Quintet is back and this time the promotion is picking MMA teams rather than its traditional focus on BJJ affiliations.
While 2019 saw Kinecktic take up the mantle for team grappling on Fight Pass, many fans have called for the Sakuraba-led Quintet to return. According to a recent announcement, Quintet will be back and bigger than ever.
Following an official announcement on the UFC 244 pay-per-view, it appears that Quintet Ultra will feature team battles between ZUFFA owned promotions with PRIDE, WEC, Strikeforce and the UFC all set to face off in December.
While there have been no mention of teams, it is probably safe to assume Sakuraba will take the helm of the PRIDE team. PRIDE has a wealth of former ADCC champs that have fought in the company so it will be interesting to see who they can get on the mats.
The UFC has the best access to talent, but it remains to be seen if active roster fighters will appear. If the UFC fielded a team of Kron Gracie, Demian Maia, Davi Ramos, Fabricio Werdum and Gilbert Burns, they would be unbeatable.
Quintet Ultra goes down in December in Las Vegas and while the date hasn’t officially been announced, it’s likely that it will be on the weekend of the UFC 245 pay-per-view.
