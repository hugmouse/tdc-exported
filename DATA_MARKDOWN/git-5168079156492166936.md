The students visitors were however given discount of 50 percent.This is a regular hike and is also one of the measures to improve and regulate the tourism in the country, said a tour agent. The entrance fees are charged to resolve problems regarding overcrowding due to rise in regional tourists over the years. Charging of entrance fee for the monuments will also contribute to improve tourism related facilities such as rest room, sheds and canteens, officials said.
