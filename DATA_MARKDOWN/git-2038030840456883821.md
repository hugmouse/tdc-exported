Cape Town - Angelina Jolie admitted that early in her career she failed to secure a part she auditioned for because of her fashion choices, as the shiny PVC material had "fused together" during her wait to be called to audition.
Speaking about her sense of style growing up, she said: "At school I wasn't that popular person. I was a punk. I loved leather, PVC, and fishnets. Those were my three favourite fabrics in my early 20s. I remember the first time I wore PVC pants. I was waiting for an audition, sitting in the sun in LA. By the time it was my turn, my pants had fused together. I didn't get the part."
But the experience didn't impact Angelina's love for PVC, as she also recalled wearing a similar outfit when she married her first husband Jonny Lee Miller.
