Following a very successful UFC 244 event in New York, the promotion is taking the Octagon back overseas to Russia this week for UFC on ESPN+ 21, or UFC Moscow if you prefer. The card has seen its fair share of shuffling in recent weeks due to injuries and other circumstances, but they’ve set up a cracker of a main event.
This fight was supposed to happen earlier, but it’s probably better than it’s going down here. Russian featherweight standout Zabit Magomedsharipov will meet Calvin Kattar on top after Junior dos Santos was forced to pull out of his fight with Alexander Volkov due to injury. Instead, Volkov will meet late replacement Greg Hardy (?) in the co-main event.
Here’s a look at the current card, scheduled for November 9th in the CSKA Arena in Moscow:
