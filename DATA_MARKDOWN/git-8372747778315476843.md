LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- The WWE is bringing WrestleMania 36 to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa next year, but you will be able to get tickets on a special pre-sale next week.
The event was announced in March, revealing that the latest WrestleMania will take place on April 5, 2020, and will include a week-long celebration in Tampa.
Other activities planned include, WrestleMania Axxess, WWE’s interactive fan festival, as well as four nights of events; SmackDown® Live; 2020 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony; NXT® TakeOver™ and Monday Night Raw®. WWE will also host more than a dozen community outreach events, including hospital visits and Be a STAR® bullying prevention rallies, designed to give back to the local region, according to a press release.
"This is truly the biggest event our community has ever coveted but hasn't had the chance to host," said Executive Director Tampa Bay Sports Commission Rob Higgins.
The general public on-sale is scheduled for Friday, November 15th at 10 a.m.. However, we have a special link to gain access to a pre-sale beginning Wednesday, November 13th at 10 a.m.
