This weekend’s Telkom Knockout saw three of the four matches decided on penalties and saw a total of 11 goals scored. 
The Telkom Knockout action started on Friday evening where the in-form Maritzburg United and Highlands Park battled it out at the Harry Gwala Stadium. In a physical match with relatively few chances, The Team of Choice came out victorious on penalties. 
From the fierce Soweto Derby that swung both ways during the 120 minutes, Ernst Middendorp and Rulani Mokwena set up their players to perform without fear, which is what the South African soccer-loving audience received.
In the late Saturday kick-off between SuperSport United and Golden Arrows, a brilliant Lindokuhle Mtshali free-kick saw Abafana bas’thende shock Kaitano Tembo’s men, to reach the semi-final.
On Sunday, Mamelodi Sundowns found the going tough, against a tricky Chippa United outfit. After equalizing twice in the match, Mosimane’s men eventually came out victorious on penalties at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.  
With that brief summary of the weekend’s results, have a go at selecting your Team of the Week and see how close you get to the official Soccer Laduma selection.
