Arlo cameras are popular on the market, mainly due to their reliability. They're also known to be relatively expensive, but this deal will help you save a few bucks on these multi-camera kits. You get a choice of two, four, and six-pack bundles, selling for $450, $720, and $990, respectively, with savings ranging from $50 to $110.
 
The Pro 3 features a 160-degree 2K camera with an integrated spotlight and IR night vision and two-way audio with noise and echo cancellation. It also has a built-in 4,800mAh  battery, letting you place it anywhere you'd like, including outdoors. Unfortunately, the new iteration lost the free seven-day storage that came with the Pro 2, and you'll now have to pay $3 or $10 per month to store footage on the cloud. You can still save data locally on a USB device, though, which is appreciable.
