Former footballer Neil Ruddock and his ex-wife are embroiled in the latest leg of a 14-year family court money fight following the breakdown of their marriage.
Ruddock and Sarah Ruddock, who divorced more than a decade ago, were both at a private hearing overseen by a judge in the Central Family Court in London on Tuesday.
District Judge Alun Jenkins allowed a journalist to attend the hearing but imposed limits on what could be reported.
The judge said Ruddock and his ex-wife, who still uses the name Mrs Ruddock, could be named in media reports.
But he said no detail of evidence discussed could be revealed.
Mrs Ruddock was the applicant in the case and Ruddock the respondent.
Ruddock, 51, was represented by a barrister.
Mrs Ruddock, 49, represented herself.
 
The case was listed by a number which indicated that the litigation began in 2005.
Ruddock, a central defender who won one England cap, played for clubs including Southampton, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham during a career spanning more than 12 years.
He took part in the 2019 series of the BBC's Celebrity MasterChef.
