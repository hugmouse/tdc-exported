While Athiya, who turns 27 today is currently busy with the promotions of her upcoming film 'Motichoor Chaknachoor' with Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Khushi, on the other hand, is busy with her education in the prestigious New York Film Academy.
The trio can be seen having a gala time with Shanaya Kapoor also joining them in this throwback video which was captioned "Happy bday babies" by Ananya.
