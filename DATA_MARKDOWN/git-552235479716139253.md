The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after three ducks were found in Wishaw.
Scotland’s animal welfare charity was alerted to two Indian runner ducks by a motorist on November 4.
A further single muscovy duck was found the next day just a few streets away from where the first two ducks were picked up.
Scottish SPCA animal rescue officer Stephanie Kirk said: “The Indian runner ducks were found on Campbell Street which is a busy road.
“Luckily the birds were uninjured and we are grateful to the member of the public for reporting this as they could have been hit by a car.
“We were then alerted to a muscovy duck in a nearby area.
“All three of the ducks found are domesticated breeds, so we feel it’s likely they’ve come from the same place.
“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”
