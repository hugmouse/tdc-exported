The wall had seven official crossing points, the most famous being Checkpoint Charlie, which was located in the heart of Berlin in a sector secured by American troops
In a high-stakes standoff at the checkpoint in October 1961, the US and Soviet militaries stared each other down for several hours in a dispute over an attempt by the US diplomat Allan Lightner to visit East Berlin

The Baywatch star David Hasselhoff makes an appearance with a fleet of Lada cars. Hasselhoff holds a barely believable iconic status in Germany. He performed his No 1 hit Looking for Freedom on New Year’s Eve 1989, two months after the Berlin Wall came down. The song became an anthem of hope for the people of East Germany during the 1980s
