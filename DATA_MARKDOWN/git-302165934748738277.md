KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 4 — Bursa Malaysia rose 0.64 per cent to end at the day’s high on the back of consistent buying in index-linked counters at the eleventh hour.
At 5pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) was up 10.22 points at 1,603.56 compared with Friday’s close of 1,593.34.
The key index opened 4.94 points higher at 1,598.28, which was also the intra-day low.
An analyst said this was in line with the positive market sentiment both locally and globally, which had pushed the local bourse to break through its immediate resistance level of 1,600.
On the broader market of Bursa Malaysia, gainers outnumbered losers 451 to 361, while 410 counters were unchanged, 738 untraded and 28 others suspended.
Volume expanded to 2.5 billion shares worth RM1.85 billion from 2.3 billion shares worth RM1.91 billion last Friday.
The biggest gainers among the heavyweights included Petronas Chemicals, which climbed 14 sen to RM7.62 and added 1.97 to the FBM KLCI, while Tenaga Nasional rose 12 sen to RM14.00, contributing 1.20 to the index.
Among the other heavyweights, Kuala Lumpur Kepong was up 28 sen at RM21.98, while Digi and Dialog both added three sen to RM4.71 and RM3.50, respectively.
An analyst said the index’s movement was in line with its regional peers which showed positive performance across the board.
“We can see that the index had a steady climb today from the opening, and interest spiked in the last 10 minutes of trading, witnessing an incremental jump on the KLCI from 8.06 to 10.22.
“We expect the momentum will continue as it has surpassed its resistance level, backed by the upbeat global market environment,” she said.
As at 5pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.11 per cent higher at 27,347.36, Singapore Straits Times rose 0.20 per cent to 3,235.73, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.65 per cent to 27,547.30 while South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 1.43 per cent to 2,130.24.
