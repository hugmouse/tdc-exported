Leonardo Castro recently reminded fans exactly what he is made of when he scored an impressive hat-trick against his former side, Mamelodi Sundowns, in the Shell Ultra Helix Cup.
 Off the field, the deadly striker has swag in bucket loads and we check out some of his best looks.

        Check out some of his most daring looks in the gallery above.
      
 The Columbian formed part of the deadly ‘CBD’ trident alongside Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly at Downs.  For Chiefs, he is still alongside Billiat, but they have since formed a new partnership with Serbian workhorse, Samir Nurkovic.

 When he is not a devastating number nine in Amakhosi colours, Castro is a doting dad and husband. A quick look through his Instagram page and it’s easy to see that he is all about family.
 When it comes to his swag, he doesn’t fare too badly either. He is a typical jeans and sneakers kind of guy, though he does clean up well when he goes for a more formal look.

         
        Having seen Castro’s rejuvenated form, do you think he can put Pirates to the sword this weekend?
