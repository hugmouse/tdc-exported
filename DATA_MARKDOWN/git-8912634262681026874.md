RIYADH: The Saudi Human Rights Commission (HRC) has detailed plans for a new collaboration between the HRC and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the first of its kind in the MENA region. The collaboration was outlined at an event at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on Sunday.The event launched a workshop centered around two initiatives: The National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up (NMRF) and the National Recommendations Tracking Database (NRTD).
