The official said that the 11, one of them a teenage female were confessed members of the Militia ng Bayan operating under the NPA’s Guerrilla Front 73 headed by one ‘Commander MacMac.’
“Due to fear for their lives, hardship and seeing that no progress and improvement on the ideologies that they are fighting for, the 11 decided to return their allegiance to the government side,” said Corpus.
In a report to Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa, the PRO12 director said that the 11 guerrillas yielded to members of the Senator Ninoy Aquino Municipal Police Station and the Charlie Company of the     Army’s 37th Infantry Battalion.
Ten of them were male adults residing in Sitio Sebing, Barangay Midtungok in Senator Ninoy Aquino municipality while the 11th is a 16-year old female.
Corpus said that all 10 males are now under the custody of the local police while the teenager was placed under the safekeeping of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office.
Corpus said that the surrender of the 11 is another proof that the CPP/NPA movement in the region is already weakening. “A large number of their members have already been arrested by our troops while many who have realized that there is no good in staying with the rebel force and fighting for nothing, an unclear ideology for patriotism have surrendered since they felt they are being made the sacrificial lamb of their organization,” the official said.
