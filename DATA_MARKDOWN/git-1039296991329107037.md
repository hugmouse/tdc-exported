The Rally Kit is ready-to-fit but has not been homologated for road use.
Hero has revealed two new products at EICMA 2019 – the 1.R Concept and this, the Rally Kit for the Xpulse 200. Hero has said that the Rally Kit has been designed to serve as a catapult for young talents across the globe for improving their off-road riding, as well as to participate in rally events. However, the kit is not homologated for use on the road.
The kit includes fully adjustable, taller suspension at either end, a flatter seat, extended gear lever, handlebar risers, and dirt tyres to improve its off-road prowess. The engine remains unchanged and continues to be the 199.6cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled motor that produces 18.4hp and 17.1Nm of torque. However, the sprockets have been changed to a 12T front and a 40T rear. From the looks of it, the kit appears to be similar to the one on the Xpulse that was spied a couple of weeks before its official launch earlier this year.
The Rally Kit is a ready-to-fit unit that's compatible with the Xpulse 200. Prices and further details on availability will be known in the near future.
