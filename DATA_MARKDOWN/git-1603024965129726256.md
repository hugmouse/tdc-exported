The company said a challenging operating environment with continuing weak consumer sentiment had impacted the travel segment primarily in the outbound and domestic businesses.
Commenting on the financial performance, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd Chairman and Managing Director Madhavan Menon said, "This has been a challenging quarter for the travel industry with the collapse of Jet Airways leading to a surge in airfares, as well as the negative impact on customers and to the entire Indian Travel industry caused by the closure of Cox & Kings."
