PHO nurse Kimpee Jayson Cruz said 7,566 dengue cases were recorded up from the 7,376 cases in the same period last year.  
“The highest number of dengue cases this year was recorded in August, with 2,052, but it went down to 1,863 in September,” Cruz said.
He said that the most commonly-affected age group is from five to nine and 10-14 years old.
The top 10 on the PHO’s watch list of areas with high incidence of dengue are San Carlos City (624 cases), Bayambang (486), Malasiqui (423), Lingayen (386), Calasiao (318), Bugallon (298), Rosales (266), Bani (247), Binmaley (246), and San Quintin (243).  
Cruz said the PHO recorded 11 dengue deaths during the said period in the municipalities of Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Malasiqui and Villasis, with one each, and two cases each in the towns of Balungao, San Quintin and Tayug.  
He urged the public to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings and to practice the Department of Health’s 4S Kontra Dengue to prevent the mosquito-borne disease.
