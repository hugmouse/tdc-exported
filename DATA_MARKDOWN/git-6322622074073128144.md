BENGALURU (Nov 5): Southeast Asian stock markets closed higher on Tuesday, with Philippines rising the most, as risk appetite was boosted by a report that the United States was planning to drop some tariffs on Chinese goods.
Global equities rose after the Financial Times reported that the United States was considering rolling back levies on US$112 billion of Chinese imports as a concession to a partial deal, which could be signed this month, according to US officials.
"If the US does roll back existing tariffs, the positive spillover will extend beyond financial markets, as such a move would alleviate the downwards pressures on global trade conditions as well," said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM in a note.
Meanwhile, the central bank of China cut interest rates on its medium-term lending facility loans to support economic growth and tackle any fallout from the country's trade dispute with the United States.

Bank Mandiri (Persero) and poultry feed producer Charoen Pokphand Indonesia were up 4.7% and 6.6%, respectively.
The country's economy grew at its weakest pace in over two years in the third quarter, signalling the possibility of further stimulus measures.
An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks ended 2.4% higher.
Singapore's benchmark index closed at its highest in over three months, rising on the back of consumer and industrial firms.
