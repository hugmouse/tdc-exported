NEW DELHI: Supply shortfalls due to delay in arrival of stocks in mandis across the country has seen prices of onions in some cities soar by up to 40% in the last one week.
The kitchen staple was selling in the range of Rs 60-80 per kg across several cities on Tuesday. While government claimed that the prices will moderate soon, experts said the sharp fluctuation in prices would continue for another month until the delayed crop reaches the wholesale markets.
As per official data from consumer affairs ministry, retail onion prices in Delhi shot up to Rs 80 a kg on Tuesday as compared to Rs 55 on October 31.
“There will be sharp fall and increase in prices as the availability of onions in market is less and farmers are hardly left with any stock. Usually, the winter crop reaches mandis by November 1. But this year the crop has has been damaged in many parts of the country due to rains. There will be adequate availability of the crop by this month end,” said Satish Bhonde, former additional director of National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation.
