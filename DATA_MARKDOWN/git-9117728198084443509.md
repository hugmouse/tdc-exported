        Aston Martin Red Bull Racing star Max Verstappen backs himself and his team for Sunday's United States Grand Prix, as the Dutchman finished less than a tenth of a second off the pace in qualifying as he'll start from third place at the Circuit of the Americas.
      
Verstappen will have fond memories of last season's fantastic recovery drive where he finished second after starting from the back of the grid, fighting hard for the second step on the podium with Lewis Hamilton.
Valtteri Bottas eventually took pole position and Sebastian Vettel snook in front of Verstappen as well with under half a tenth of difference.
Still, the seven-time Grand Prix winner took plenty of positives from the result as he eyes to finish higher than where he'll start in Sunday's race.
"For us on this track to be that competitive is a very good result, and qualifying was just very tight," the 22-year-old said as the top four drivers were separated by just over a tenth of a second.

        "Normally we are quite good in the race, this time even compared to last year, we were much more competitive in qualifying. It leaves us very hopeful for tomorrow."
