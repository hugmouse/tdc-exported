Country music superstar Blake Shelton has been announced as a headliner at the 2020 Calgary Stampede.
The Grammy nominee will hit the Saddledome stage on Saturday, July 11, as part of the Virgin Mobile Stampede Concert Series.
Shelton’s current single ‘God’s Country’ is his 26th number one hit on country radio. The platinum-selling musician has earned a slew of honours throughout his career, including 20 ACM nominations and both male and overall video of the year trophies at the 2018 CMT Awards.
“Blake Shelton will be a huge concert on the final Saturday of Stampede,” says Adam Oppenheim, president of Stampede Entertainment Inc.
“He is an unparalleled entertainer, and his songs are Stampede anthems. I can think of no better artist to ring in a Calgary Stampede Saturday night.”
Tickets go on sale on Nov. 15 at 10 a.m. starting at $59.99. Tickets will be available on Ticketmaster and also includes admission to the Stampede on the day of the concert.
The 2020 Calgary Stampede will run from July 3 to 12.
