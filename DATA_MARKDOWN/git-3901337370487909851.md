Another trophy slipped away from the Buccaneers, who suffered a penalty shoot-out loss to Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the quarter-finals over the weekend.
In the league though, Pirates will be aiming for back-to-back victories for the first time this season after they defeated Highlands Park 1-0 seven days ago in Tembisa.
Rhulani Mokwena is forced in to a change for tonight's encounter as Thembinkosi Lorch will be suspended after picking up his fourth yellow card of the season against Chiefs on Saturday.
Pirates will be coming up against a Maritzburg outfit in superb form as the penalty shoot-out triumph over Highlands Park in the Telkom Knockout extended their winning run to five matches in all competitions.
Maritzburg's league form has certainly picked up after a slow start, as they have won their last three matches without a conceding a goal.
The last time these two sides met, the Buccaneers walked away with a 1-0 victory at the Harry Gwala Stadium.
