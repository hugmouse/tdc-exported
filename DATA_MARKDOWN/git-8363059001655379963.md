The show will come to Channel 4 two months after its US debut on Adult Swim.
Season 4 of Rick and Morty is coming to Channel 4 in January 2020, with repeats on E4, and a streaming option on All 4. The US premiere date of November 10 was announced last month, which consists of the first five episodes of the 10 episode series, so we'll have to wait a couple of months to get involved, which definitely won't lead to people pirating the show.
"Millions of fans have been waiting for more than two years for a new series of Rick and Morty, the most brilliantly bonkers show on television," said Ian Katz, director of programme. "We’re thrilled that it will be aired exclusively on Channel 4 and I promise it will be worth the wait.”
We got our first peek at the new series this summer and the official Twitter account has been sharing tidbits of what's in store ever since.
The air date for the second half of series 4 has yet to be confirmed on either side of the pond.
