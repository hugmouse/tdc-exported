        McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has said he was relieved with the way his team reacted to the struggles in Mexico. Both drivers finished well inside the top ten at the United States Grand Prix with Lando Norris coming through in 7th, while his teammate Carlos Sainz finishing just below in 8th.
      
McLaren are comfortably clear in 3rd place in the constructors' standings, currently 38 points ahead of Renault going into the final two races.
“The main thing for us was bouncing back after a very difficult Sunday in Mexico, so I’m happy with the outcome that we could score 10 points and had a solid race weekend,” Seidl told Racer.com.
“Very positive for me was the qualifying performance because it looks like in qualifying now we clearly could make a step compared to the other cars in the midfield.
