REUTERS: English champions Saracens have been given a 35-point deduction and fined £5.36 million after they were found guilty of breaching salary cap regulations, Premiership Rugby said on Tuesday.
British media reported the breaches related to England internationals such as Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Mako and Billy Vunipola entering into business partnerships with club chairman Nigel Wray.
Saracens, who accomplished the Premiership and European double last season, were fourth in the standings this season with nine points from three games before the punishment was announced.
