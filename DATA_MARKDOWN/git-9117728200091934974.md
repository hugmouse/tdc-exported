        Daniel Ricciardo would rather closer racing rather than faster lap times. The 2021 rule changes will see cars being able to follow each other better but will not be as fast as the cars currently used. 
      
“I don’t mind,” Ricciardo said to RaceFans. “I think actually one of the most fun years I had in F1 was 2014. And the cars then were eight seconds slower or something than they are now.

        “I was actually just in our meeting, there was the FOM coverage, [they] were filming the go karters. There’s some rental cars and there was two battling and I was getting excited just watching them. They’re going probably 30 miles an hour. But I think anything that is going to be close, I think that’s exciting.
      

        “So I would rather have good racing than single file lap records. Then we might as well just do time trials for the rest of our career. So I’m okay with three seconds slower.”
      
The racing in 2021 is set to be a lot closer than recent years and the cars will get faster throughout the season as the teams learn how to improve them.
