This November, the highly sought-after AirPods Pro are already getting their first price cut after a little over a week via Amazon. The online marketplace is scraping US$15 off the AirPods Pro, allowing buyers to get their hands on the earbuds for US$234.99. Some might want to wait till Black Friday to get the best deal out of their purchase, though the price of the regular AirPods was only reduced by US$7 during the previous massive sales event. Then again, the headphones market has become more competitive than ever, which means the cost of Apple’s noise-cancelling headphones could get lower.
