Cape Town - Kaizer Chiefs defender Njabulo Blom has paid tribute to his team-mates to guiding him through a high-pressure tie with Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday.
Despite only being 19-years-old, he played with a maturity beyond his years as he made two goal-saving interventions to help Chiefs to a crucial 2-0 victory and give them a major boost in the title race.
The versatile defender now has another stern challenge with the upcoming Soweto derby on Saturday as Amakhosi take on Orlando Pirates.
Speaking to Chiefs’ official website about that encounter, 'Stoppa' explained: "The game against Arrows was the most challenging for me because it was my first professional game.
"I was nervous, but the other guys helped me out and got me to settle in well. It was the kind of game which could have made me or broke me.
"Thanks to God my performance was good. We won and it has motivated me and helped me believe in my abilities."
Saturday’s Soweto derby clash starts at 15:00.
