        At the age of 22, Max Verstappen might have spent much of his childhood looking up to Lewis Hamilton who is on the verge of winning his sixth Formula 1 world championship. The Dutchman says it's an amazing feat but would love to compete with him in an equal car. 
      
Verstappen qualified ahead of Hamilton for the United States Grand Prix after Hamilton aborted his final lap of Q3. In the media after the session, Verstappen was asked what Hamilton means him. 
"From my side, unfortunately, I haven’t really had the time to compete with him that much. I mean, just a few races. Most of the time we didn’t have equal material but he was always clearly the better of the two within the team. And then, when you have the best car out there, of course you can win the Championship. It’s amazing, of course, to go for your sixth World Championship," Verstappen said.
