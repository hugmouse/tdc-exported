A lot of parents wonder about the right age at which they can leave their children alone at home. Verdicts vary from parents to caregivers but there is official data on it now. A big number of social workers were surveyed and they felt that children should be a minimum of 12 years of age before they are left at home - however, the duration should not be too much beyond 4 hours.
According to a research conducted by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children view being left alone at home as neglect, especially when they are injured and left unsupervised.
One of the clinical professors and pediatrician, Charles Jennissen commented, "We found that social workers who participated in the study were significantly more likely to consider it child neglect when a child was left home alone if the child had suffered an injury, as compared to when they did not."
Approximately 80 per cent social workers felt that leaving a child under 8 years or younger alone at home was neglect, while 50 per cent felt that a even children under 10 who are left alone at home falls in the same category of neglect. However, a low number of social workers rated kids 12 to 14 being left alone as 'neglect'.
It needs to be seen that lack of adult supervision contributes to more than 40 per cent of US pediatric injury-related deaths, according to ANI.
