Muscat: In line with the efforts to promote integrated logistics services, an agreement for the development of a truck rest area with a total investment of OMR2.5 million over an area of 50,000 square metres was signed on Monday at Sohar Port and Freezone.Initiated by the Ministry of Transport and spearheaded by Asyad, the truck rest area will assist in promoting road safety after the significant increase in the number of trucks at the port.The area will offer an added value to the logistics infrastructure of the port and freezone to all its tenants from various road transport companies, through the provision of a dedicated area for truck drivers to take breaks during long journeys.Apart from streamlining logistics at the port, it will also aid in saving transit time between destinations and reducing road congestion by preventing drivers from parking at the sides of the road and in residential areas.
The importance of this project is also demonstrated by its role of unifying operators and tenants of both the port and freezone.Sohar Port and Freezone celebrated its 15th anniversary in a glittering ceremony at the Kempinski Hotel Muscat, on Monday. The event was conducted under the auspices of Dr Ahmed Mohammed Al Futaisi, Minister of Transport, alongside the presence of distinguished excellencies, ministers, dignitaries, partners and members of the port management.“15 years since the inception of Sohar port and freezone, we are proud to have established a world-class port on the coasts of Oman to serve the region and the world.
