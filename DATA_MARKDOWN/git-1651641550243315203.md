Last month the folks over at XDA Developers found traces code that pointed towards a likely launch of a smartphone from Xiaomi with zoom camera. The code was found inside a beta software update of MiUI 11 rolled by Xiaomi.
Now it looks like the information was right as Letsgodigital has uncovered a patent showing the design of a device with a zoom camera. The patent was titled “Mobile Phone” was published by The Hague International Design System on August 9, 2019. The patent shows sketches of a smartphone with a zoom camera on the top followed by two more cameras and what looks like a ToF sensor or a flash.
The sketches also show a popup front camera which is aligned with the rear camera setup. Earlier today, Xiaomi introduced the Mi CC9 which also has a really good camera setup. With the way, Xiaomi has been targetting mobile camera users, we might be able to see this patent in action soon.
