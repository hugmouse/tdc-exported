Stoke City have reportedly made a shock 'bid' for Scotland boss Steve Clarke to become their new manager.
The Championship side are looking for a new gaffer after sacking Nathan Jones last week.
And according to the Scottish Sun , the Potters have made an ambitious move for the former Kilmarnock man.
The same report claims that Clarke has knocked back their approach.
The Championship side targeted Preston's Alex Neil at the weekend, but were also unsuccessful with their attempts.
Clarke took charge of Scotland in May but has suffered a frustrating spell on the Hampden touchline, with only two wins from six games.
 
Scotland failed to qualify from their Euro 2020 group, but have a chance to reach the tournament with a play-off tie in March.
Clarke named his 25-man squad for their two remaining group games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan as they look to build momentum for the crucial game next year.
