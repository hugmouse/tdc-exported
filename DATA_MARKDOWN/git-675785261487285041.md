James Maddison is hoping his casino own goal will not be held against him when Gareth Southgate names his England squad.
Leicester midfielder Maddison was sent home ill from England’s last camp but was pictured in a casino while Southgate’s men played in the Czech Republic last month.
England manager Southgate gave Maddison a stern warning that he would have to watch how he behaves in the public eye in future but has yet to speak to him personally.
He is certain to address the issue with Maddison if he includes him for the qualifiers with Montenegro and Kosovo as England look to book their place at Euro 2020.
Southgate has been watching Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish in recent weeks and is ready to give him his first call up if the midfielder is fit having missed his club’s last game against Liverpool .
The manager has been hugely impressed with Grealish in recent weeks, making regular checks on him and wants to include him if he is fit.
It would be hard to see both Grealish and Maddison in the squad but with injuries they could both get the nod.
Midfield is the big area of concern for Southgate with Ross Barkley – the two-goal hero in Bulgaria – in danger of missing out having missed recent Chelsea games through injury but is now fit.
Jordan Henderson is suspended for England’s first game with Montenegro a week today, so that may tempt Southgate to name an enlarged squad with potential recalls for Dele Alli and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
Oxlade-Chamberlain, 26, is in great form after four goals in his last three starts and, having missed out last time, could be back. Alli is also playing again for Spurs after missing out last month.
Harry Winks was left out of Spurs’ squad for Belgrade in the Champions League which is a worry and is bizarre given his recent impressive form.
Chelsea’s Mason Mount also limped off against Ajax on Tuesday night and England will make fitness checks.
Meanwhile, Manchester City defender John Stones could come back with Everton ’s Michael Keane at risk having been dropped in Bulgaria last month and he was also axed at Goodison Park on Sunday.
Stones has had a turbulent season with injury and form but Southgate remains a big admirer and having right footed centre halves remains an issue.
Chelsea’s Fikayo Tomori and Tyrone Mings are set to keep their places in the squad while Danny Rose’s dip in form is a concern at Tottenham but he would seem likely to keep his place with Luke Shaw just returning to training.
