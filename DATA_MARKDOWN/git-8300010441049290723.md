ECHO PARK, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Three people were killed and another was in stable condition Friday after a police pursuit ended in a crash just off the 101 Freeway in Echo Park.The SUV rolled over just after 4 a.m. following a chase involving Los Angeles police, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.LAPD spokesman Drake Madison said officers had been pursuing one of the three burglary suspect vehicles for about three minutes when the car rolled over.Officials say pursuing officers and a police helicopter lost sight of the vehicle, and moments later, police located the overturned SUV near the Echo Park off-ramp.Firefighters worked to free the four suspects, all said to be between 20 and 30 years old. Three were pronounced dead at the scene and a fourth was taken to an area hospital."Just by looking at how the vehicle looks, possibly the vehicle tried to take the off-ramp maybe too fast and lost control," a California Highway Patrol spokesperson said.The northbound on- and off- ramps at Rampart Boulevard were closed by California Highway Patrol during the investigation. Traffic was not significantly impacted during the morning rush hour.Police are still looking for the suspects who fled in the other two vehicles.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
