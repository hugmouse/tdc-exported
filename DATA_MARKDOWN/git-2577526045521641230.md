Untitled Goose Game has quickly become one of the most popular games of 2019. It turns out people love honking and annoying villagers. Makes sense. But the camera in the game is limited and this makes it hard to see what’s inside some buildings or other out-of-bounds secrets.
Lucky for us, the YouTube channel Boundary Break with a magic camera and can show us everything hidden in Untitled Goose Game. We have featured Boundary Break on Kotaku many, many times before and for good reason. The creator of the channel, Shesez, is great at using no clip cameras to move around games, finding hidden bits of content or things players were never meant to see.
