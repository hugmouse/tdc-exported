In the mood for some al fresco partying?1OAK, the New York-born nightclub in Business Bay, is opening a brand-new terrace lounge and Time Out Dubai has been down to have a look.With views of the Dubai Water Canal, the new terrace has been designed for partygoers to enjoy top-notch late-night cuisine and will be served from 2am to 5am in the morning – a pleasant change from the usual 3am shawarma pit-stop.The late-night menu has been designed by Richard Turner – the chef behind London’s Hawksmoor, Pitt Cue, Blacklock, and Meatopia Festival – so we can't wait to see what's in store. It’s set to launch next week so watch this space.The swanky new terrace will also be open daily from 8pm onwards for shisha and mixed drinks.For all the latest restaurant news, deals, openings and events across the city click here.Looking for more places to go for a late night feast?
