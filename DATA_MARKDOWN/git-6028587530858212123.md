With a list totaling 374 starred restaurants, the recent release of the MICHELIN Guide Italy 2020 makes Italy the country with the second most Michelin starred restaurants in the world (after France).“Thirty-three new starred restaurants overlook the culinary scene offering their own personal testimony of the infinite variations of the Bel Paese kitchen,” commented Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the MICHELIN Guides, announcing the release.
”Above all, the new three-star restaurant Enrico Bartolini shines at the Mudec [a museum of art and culture], where the chef's personality stands out for research and experimentation, blending perfectly with Milan's dynamism and giving an artist's touch to the rich Italian gastronomic heritage,” said Poullennec. This brings the number of three-star restaurants in Italy to 11. 
The guide, now in its 65th edition, has also added two new “deserve a detour” two-starred restaurants, La Madernassa, in Guarene (in the province of Cuneo) and Glam by Enrico Bartolini in Venice—making a total of 35 two-starred restaurants.
If you are a food lover and your travel plans aren’t yet firm—after dining in the new three-star in Milan—you might want to had to the Lombardy region, which claims the highest number of stars in the guide: 3 three-star, 5 two-star and 54 one-star establishments. Piedmont comes in a close second with 46 starred restaurants, and Campania comes in at third place with 44 starred restaurants.
