Paris - Frenchman Gael Monfils moved to within one victory of securing the last spot at the ATP Tour Finals by fighting back from a set and a break down to beat Moldovan Radu Albot in the Paris Masters third round on Thursday.
The 13th seed, who needs to reach the semi-finals at Bercy to snatch the last ATP Finals spot from Italy's Matteo Berrettini, will face Canadian rising star Denis Shapovalov in the last eight on Friday.
The 33-year-old fell a break down at 4-3 in the second set, but rallied with the help of the home crowd to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 in a match which finished at 23:40 local time.
Monfils was knocked out at the round-robin stage on his only previous Tour Finals appearance in 2016.
The end-of-season event gets underway on November 10 in London.
