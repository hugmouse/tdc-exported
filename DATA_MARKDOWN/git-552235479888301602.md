Andy Murray and his wife Kim are celebrating the birth of a baby boy.
It is the 32-year-old tennis star's third child with Andy and Kim already parents to girls Sophia, three and Edie, two.
The family's latest addiction was born last week but the couple have only now told their friends that they have had wee boy.
The Sun says the baby was born at a hospital in London.
The Mirror reports that it isn't yet known the name the couple have decided to pick for the baby .
Andy's grandfather Roy Erskine, 88, told the Sun: "It's a wee boy.
"He was born during the week, I don't know what his name is yet. My wife is away down, she went down this morning."
 
Meanwhile, Andy recently joked after winning the European Open that he needed to get back to touring as his family is getting 'out of control'.
"I've got two young kids and a third one coming. I'll have three kids under four years old," he said.
"When I've been off the tour the last few years my family has got bigger.
"I need to get on the road so we're done before it gets out of control!
"I'm excited for the third kid. My wife has been a huge support in getting me back on the court.
"She's helped me fight to keep playing."
