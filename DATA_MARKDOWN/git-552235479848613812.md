Pepe has asked Porto fans to trust them ahead of the trip to face Rangers on Thursday.
The veteran defender has pleaded with supporters to get behind the team and manager during the Europa League showdown at Ibrox .
Porto have recently been rocked after a series of poor performances, which included Rangers holding the Portuguese giants to a 1-1 draw.
Manager Sergio Conceicao admitted there was an environment of distrust surrounding the club after the fans whistled at them despite beating Aves 1-0 at home.
 
And Pepe, 36, has demanded the fans are more patient before they play Rangers in Glasgow.
He said: "The fans must realise we cannot win every match by three or four goals. It's the same three points no matter the scoreline. Football doesn't work that way.
"It's not an easy league and every game is difficult. To get the win was very important.
"I say to the fans that we have to be united - the players and the supporters. We need them to trust us.
"There is a great team spirit at this club and we now go to Scotland with plenty of confidence determined to get a win this time against Rangers."
