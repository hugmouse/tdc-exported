The owner of a pickup truck involved in a crash that left two dead in Kamloops early Sunday morning has been arrested.
Police said two were killed in a crash between a car and a pickup truck that closed 1st Avenue between Seymour Street and Nicola Street.
“Due to the severity of this collision, our investigation could take most of the day,” says RCMP Cpl. Jodi Shelkie. “We thank motorists for avoiding this area and taking alternate routes.”
Kamloops RCMP were called to a motor vehicle collision on 1st Avenue and Battle Street at 1:40 a.m. on Nov. 3. The collision involved a car with four occupants and a pickup truck.
When officers arrived they found that two occupants of the car were already deceased. The other two occupants — one in life-threatening condition and the other with non-life threatening injuries — were taken to Royal Inland Hospital. The driver of the pickup truck had left the area before police arrived but the registered owner has since been arrested.
