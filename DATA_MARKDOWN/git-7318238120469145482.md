Art festivals in Georgia displaying handcrafted dolls draw artists from around the world.
Each detail and article of clothing on these dolls is a work of art.
Dolls by the celebrated German doll maker Sylvia Weser, for instance, can cost up to $10,000.
The skeletons of her dolls are covered in leather and the face and arms are made of porcelain. It's hand-painted to get the features right.
Some of the dolls are ornamented with semi-precious stones or crystals.
"I was in love with my dolls and I never thought I would sell them. I made them just for me for my own collection and today I'm worldwide invited in Moscow, in New York, [and] Florida," Weser said.
Art dolls presented at the exhibition vary in style, palette and technique, but this diversity makes the dolls unique.
