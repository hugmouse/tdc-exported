Quriyat: Quriyat in the Muscat Governorate this year saw an exceptional season due to the large daily landing of Yellowfin Tuna in the market, which is one of the most important sources of livelihood for the Omani fisherman.The Yellowfin Tuna is one of the most famous fish in the world for its abundance in various seas of the world because it is used in food and comes in many varieties and sizes.The Yellowfin Tuna has different names, sizes and shapes inside and outside Oman and there are many methods for fishing them, the most famous traditional method being with the hook or net.The Yellowfin Tuna land in the Wilayat of Quriyat as soon as the boats arrive to the harbour and are later displayed in the wilayat’s fish market, which receives large quantities daily. Landing starts at 4am and continues until after 8pm on some days.
They are sold by auction to consumers from different parts of the Sultanate who line up around the catch, bid on them and select the most suitable ones. During the morning, some other fish species are also available, but in smaller quantities as larger quantities are available in the afternoon.The Wilayat of Quriyat is famous for the abundance of diverse fishes, especially the Yellowfin Tuna. Although the quantities have gradually gone down, but with government efforts to stop illegal fishing and other efforts it has resulted in increasing the number to its normal levels. This year marked a milestone in the amount of fish landed in the local markets and it will have a prominent role in export.Citizens in the Wilayat of Quriyat maintain a long-standing fishing profession where young people continue to practice it and is one of the wilayat’s main professions and a source of livelihood for many citizens.The Sultanate exports a wide variety of fish, including Yellowfin Tuna and Japan, China and Vietnam are the top consuming countries of Omani fish.The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is making great efforts to preserve the fisheries wealth, and establish many facilities to fishermen, most notably the follow-up of sea fishing market and preparing it to receive and display fish. Fish are also marketed and sold by auction, a traditional method preferred by citizens.Nasser bin Saleh Al Ghazali, Director of Fisheries Development Department in the Wilayat of Quriyat, told Oman News Agency (ONA), “The prices of the Yellowfin Tuna (size 40 kilograms) are between OMR20 to OMR24, and OMR27-30 for 50 kilograms. The price for 80 kilograms Yellowfin Tuna is OMR60.”The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has provided 30 licenses for modern fishing boats that can be used for high sea fishing. The boats contain all necessary amenities and all means of fish storage, which could contribute to boosting fish quantities and raising the income of the Omani fisherman.
