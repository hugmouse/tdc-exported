LAHORE (Dunya News) – Senior leader of PTI Jahangir Tareen on Sunday said government has not stopped Azadi March at any point so opposition must stuck to the agreement.
Addressing to media in Lahore, he said Shehbaz Sharif has always spoken big words but this government is correcting the things that were badly dealt in previous regimes.
Earlier, Tareen said there are reports of huge funding for the Azadi March of JUI-F.
Talking in Dunya News program ‘Dunya kamran Khan Kay Sath,’ he said such things could not happen without resources and we know from where the funds are coming.
He said traders did not give a single penny for Azadi March but JUI-F must explain about funding as it would raise questions. He said Maulana Fazlur Rehman could not get public fame and government would not create hurdles for the marchers.
Tareen said we wish people use their democratic right and government would act responsibly, adding that roads leading to Red Zone would be blocked.
