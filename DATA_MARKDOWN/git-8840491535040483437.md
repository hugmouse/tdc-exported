A bridge between the Greenway in Turlough and the historic village is to be provided next year, it has been confirmed.
The project is to be progressed to the planning and consultation stages next month with a view to work starting in 2020.
The original plan for the bridge was shot down following some local objections.
But a new location has been found for the bridge that addresses the reservations initially raised by a number of residents.
Councillor Michael Kilcoyne, cathaoirleach, said he was disappointed the proposal had fallen behind somewhat,
But he welcomed the news that the Part 8 procedure is imminent.
Councillor Blackie Gavin said it is a step forward and the Part 8 will be supported by the elected members.
Councillor Cyrl Burke stated the project has taken a long time but is now closer to becoming a reality.
