Established in 1909, the Last Post Fund is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that no veteran is denied a dignified funeral and burial, as well as a military gravestone, due to insufficient funds at time of death.
Since inception, the Last Post Fund has arranged for the funeral and burial of more than 150,000 financially challenged veterans.
Under the Last Post Fund Indigenous Veterans Initiative, we will also provide qualifying Indigenous veterans with a military marker and a traditional name inscription.
Help us honour our Canadian Indigenous veterans. If you know of a veteran gravesite in need of a headstone or a veteran in need of funeral assistance, or if you are interested in helping to identify unmarked Indigenous veterans graves in your community, contact us at:
