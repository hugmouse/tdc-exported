As we approach the business end of the Uefa Champions League group stage, the last-16 is slowly beginning to take shape. 
Manchester City are among three teams, along with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, to have won all of their opening three games and are only one win away from securing their place in the knockout rounds. 
Liverpool are in a battle Napoli and Salzburg and must beat Genk on Wednesday in order to keep up the pressure on their rivals, while Chelsea meet Ajax in a top-of-the-group clash at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. 
Tottenham are in the hunt for second place behind Group B leaders Bayern and take on Red Star Belgrade in a key meeting this week. Elsewhere Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan collide in a game which could well decide who qualifies behind Barcelona in Group F, while struggling Real Madrid need all three points against Group A rivals Galatasaray.
