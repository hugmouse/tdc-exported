Update: It appears that Terry is available in the game as we speak. Enjoy!
Original Article: The newest addition to the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster, Terry Bogard, will join the battle today - 6th November - it has been confirmed.
The news comes from a presentation hosted by series director Masahiro Sakurai, which aired earlier today. Alongside the fighter, players who purchase the Terry DLC will also receive a brand new stage - the King of Fighters Stadium - 50 new pieces of music from a number of franchises, and a new Spirit Board.
Terry is the fourth fighter to be released as part of the game's Fighters Pass, which has also added Joker, Hero, and Banjo-Kazooie up until this point. The fifth and final character to be included in this pass has still not been revealed, although it has already been confirmed that the mystery character will be playable by February next year.
