A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the death of a 10-month-old baby girl.
Paramedics were called to a property on Crompton Street in Farnworth near Bolton shortly after 5.30pm on Friday. The girl was taken to hospital but died a short time later.
DCI Stuart Wilkinson, of GMP’s major incident team, said: “First and foremost, I want to extend my sincere condolences to the family of this little girl, who are being supported at this incredibly difficult time by specially trained officers.
“The investigation team is determined to understand how and why this little girl died, and we have arrested a man on suspicion of murder who will be questioned by detectives later today.
“We will be continuing with inquiries throughout the days and weeks ahead and I would encourage anyone who has information to please contact police.”
