The number of tech startups has gone up from 7,700-8,200 in 2018 to 8,900-9,300 in 2019. Of these, 28 percent are deep tech startups.
The unicorn club, too, has expanded, from 17 in 2018 to 24 in 2019 and a few more were likely to join in by the year-end.
More corporates are showing interest in the sector. As many as 80 corporate investors bet on the sector, a 10 percent increase over 2018.
