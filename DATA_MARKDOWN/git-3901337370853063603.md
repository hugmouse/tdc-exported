Highlands were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout this past weekend following a penalty shoot-out loss to Maritzburg United in KwaZulu-Natal.
Owen da Gama's charges will also be pushing for a return to winning ways after they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates in Tembisa seven days ago.
Celtic, meanwhile, have had ample time to prepare for tonight's encounter as they were not involved in cup action this weekend, although they did secure a 1-1 draw with SuperSport United last week Wednesday.
The Free State outfit currently occupy 11th position heading into the encounter, while, the Lions of the North sit in fourth spot.
Da Gama's troops will feel confident for this encounter, as they claimed the league double over Celtic last season.

        Here's how they line up:
      
Celtic: 16. Mabokgwane, 18. Mashikinya, 26. Ngobeni, 2. Tani, 35. Baloyi, 3. Mahashe, 12. Maema, 27. Tchilimbou, 9. Sera, 24. Lingwati, 8. Phalane.
