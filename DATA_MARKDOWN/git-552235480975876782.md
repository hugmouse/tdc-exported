Steven Gerrard described Ryan Jack as "a man possessed" after a star turn in the League Cup win over Hearts.
The Scotland midfielder has been one of the key men for Rangers this season and was impressive again as they set up a Betfred Cup final with Celtic next month.
Alfredo Morelos grabbed the headlines with two goals and an assist, but the Gers manager was also struck by Jack's performance.
Gerrard said: "It felt ever so different on the side today knowing you have a number nine who is in terrific form and another number nine behind you who is capable on this stage.
“We had great back-up and you can also see why we paid the money for Ryan Kent and were so desperate to get him in. He hasn’t played much over the past five months, so he’ll get better and better.
“The midfield were outstanding, they controlled the whole game. Ryan Jack was like a man possessed again. Defensively, we were solid, so I’m very happy with how all departments of the team worked today.”
Jack joined Rangers in the summer of 2017, having left Aberdeen at the end of his contract.
