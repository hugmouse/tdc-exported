Earlier this year, Dropbox started testing a new feature known as Transfer. Simply put, Transfer lets users directly share files using Dropbox’s backend. It comes with a few bells and whistles like viewership management, password protection, etc.
“Transfer is our answer to a common problem: Sometimes you simply want to hand off files. No giving people edit access to your originals, no links that let people download updates you make later—just, “Here are your files!” While email might work for a JPEG or two, collections of large multimedia files easily go well beyond the typical 25 MB attachment limit. And Dropbox shared links are best for when recipients need access to always up-to-date files,” Dropbox explained on Monday. 
Transfer lets users send up to 100GB files. We say up to because the upper limit isn’t anything close to that if you’re on one of Dropbox’s more pedestrian plans. If you’re on a basic account, you’ll get 100MB. Got a Dropbox Plus or Business Standard Account? 2GB. Professional, Business Advanced, Enterprise and Education all get the 100GB limit, so if you’re going to be sharing massive files on the regular, you’ll need to pony up.
Transfer is available to all users on all Dropbox Plans from today.
