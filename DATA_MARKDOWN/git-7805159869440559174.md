Poweramp’s latest update brought over the Powerstream feature, a feature that allowed HTTP streaming for online radios on Android smartphones. But Android smartphones as a whole tend to have a much better app ecosystem and a wider variety of options and alternatives. Radio services are also more popularly accessed during car rides, so having the ability to listen to your favorite online radio stream on Android Auto would be incredible. If you have been looking for an app to do the same on Android Auto, then check out URL Radio.
URL Radio by XDA Senior Member jamal2367 is an app for Android Auto head units that allows you to conveniently listen to your favorite stream via URL links.
To access different URL streams, you need to add the .m3u files to Android/data/com.jamal2367.urlradio/files/Collection. The dev has shared a playlist zip file which has a whole bunch of streams, so you can get up and started with little effort. 128kbit/s AAC streams can consume about 60MB per hour, so plan your usage accordingly. The app also features light and dark themes, so you can choose the theme that is best suited to your preference.
