A female supporter representative has resigned from the board of Hibernian, citing “relentless” abuse towards herself and others at the Edinburgh club from their fans. Hibs confirmed Tracey Smith’s departure on their website, while pointing out it was “saddened” by the scenario.
Smith, a business owner and mother of three who had been nominated by fellow fans in what was a voluntary position, had been on the Hibs board since March 2017. The club find themselves one point from the foot of the Scottish Premiership and without a manager, following the sacking of Paul Heckingbottom this week.
In their statement, Hibs said: “Tracey has tendered her resignation because of her concerns at the level of abusive behaviour shown by a number of supporters towards the club, staff, players and management in recent months and also due to the abuse she has suffered personally.
“In her letter Tracey was keen to stress that these behaviours were not those of most Hibernian fans but described it as ‘relentless’ and revealed that the abuse she has endured has at times forced her to seek legal and police advice.”
Bruce Langham, a non-executive director of Hibs, added: “It is very disappointing and disheartening to lose Tracey, who has been an active, valuable, and hard-working member of the board who has done her very best to represent the views of supporters at board level. Supporters who behave in this way should realise there can be consequences, in this case the loss of a colleague who contributed greatly to improving communications between fans and the board.”
