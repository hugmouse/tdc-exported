LIVINGSTON, Wis. - An Illinois man is arrested and could face more charges after a three-vehicle crash in Grant County, officials said. 
The Grant County Sheriff’s Office said the crash happened at about 7 p.m. Friday outside Livingston on Highway 80.
Officials said a 66-year-old Dodgeville woman was driving a Toyota Prius and slowed down to turn right when 35-year-old Sam Hamra, of Springfield, Illinois, failed to stop and rear-ended the car.
That car was pushed across the center line and hit a Jeep, the sheriff's office said.
The Prius driver and passenger, the 27-year-old Montfort woman who was driving the Jeep, and Hamra were all taken to area hospitals for injuries, according to the report.
Hamara was arrested on suspicion of operating while intoxicated.
That stretch of Highway 80 was closed for 5 hours during the crash, officials said.
