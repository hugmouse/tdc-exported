With a full week of festivities, celebrities across the board upped their Halloween costume game in 2019.
Halloween all-star Heidi Klum opted for a bionic alien costume for her 20th annual Halloween party, stating the look was inspired by husband Tom Kaulitz’s band, Tokio Hotel. Klum gave fans a preview of her transformation, camping out at the 34th Street Amazon Books store’s window front and posting pictures on Instagram to show the elaborate makeup and prosthetics applications.
