LAHORE (Dunya News) – The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday expressed strong anger over postgraduate training doctors – who have been protesting against Medical Teaching Institutions (MTI) Act and possible privatisation of the hospitals – for suspending treatment to patients and not appearing in the hearing today despite of court’s orders.
Justice Jawad Hassan presided over hearing of a petition against protesting doctors and remarked: “I will see which doctor refuses treatment to patients […] we will direct crackdown against protesting doctors today.”
“There is no concept of doctors going on strike all over the world […] who gives license to these doctors?” the court asked.
Health department officials told the court that the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) issues license to the medical practitioners.
Meanwhile, the court has again summoned concerned authorities and representatives of protesting doctors in the next hearing.
