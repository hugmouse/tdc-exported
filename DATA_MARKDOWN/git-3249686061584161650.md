According to media outlet reports on November 5 at approximately 3 PM KST, officials from the cyber crime investigation unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police are conducting abrupt search and seizure procedures inside CJ ENM's office building, in relation to the ongoing investigation surrounding 'Produce X 101'.
In addition, the cyber crime unit is also searching and seizing evidence at another entertainment company whose trainees participated in 'Produce X 101'. Police simply revealed, "They plan to find evidence to clarify any remaining suspicions."
