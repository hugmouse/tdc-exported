        BANGKOK (Sputnik) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah has rejected US State Secretary Mike Pompeo's suggestion that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in January be held in the United States now that Chile had pulled out of its hosting role.
      
The foreign minister did not provide details as to why he rejected the proposal.
The statement comes after Chilean President Sebastian Pinera cancelled the 2-day summit, scheduled to start on 16 November, last week amid ongoing protests in the South American country.
Abdullah said Pompeo had called him while in Bangkok to ask for Malaysia's stance on hosting the event.
Malaysia is due to host next year's APEC summit.
APEC is a regional economic forum that aims to strengthen regional economic integration among its 21 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
