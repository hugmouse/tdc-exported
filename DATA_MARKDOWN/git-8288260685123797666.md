Thomas Wall and Michael Connors, both aged 21 and Michael Wall, 25, and all from Wrexham, were previously charged with conspiracy to burgle.
 
They appeared before Walsall Magistrates Court on October 24 and were remanded in custody to appear at a later date.
Detectives are continuing to probe the series of burglaries across the region and are appealing for anyone with information to contact officers.
Detective Inspector Jim Mahon, from Force CID, said: "I would like to thank the community for their support in this investigation. Although these charges are a major step forward, we are still appealing to anyone with any information relating to the other burglaries across the Black Country to speak to us.
“We don’t underestimate the impact such crimes have on our communities and the widespread anxiety and distress they cause.
"We would continue to ask the public to remain vigilant and not to open their doors if they are unsure who is visiting.
"We ask that communities to look out for any people or vehicles acting suspiciously in their neighbourhoods and report them to us."
