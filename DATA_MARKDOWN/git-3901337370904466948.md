The Premier Soccer League has confirmed that they have written to Benni McCarthy, Steve Komphela and Owen da Gama regarding comments about match officials.
Pitso Mosimane was the first coach to receive a letter from the PSL this week in relations to comments attributed to him about match officials, where he was given five days to respond.
After Mosimane, the league thereafter wrote to Zlatko Krmpotic from Polokwane City and has since confirmed today that McCarthy, Komphela and Da Gama have also received letters with five days to either confirm or deny making statements about match officials.

Like Mosimane, McCarthy has also not held back about how he felt about decisions made by match referees, most recently when his side hosted Kaizer Chiefs at the Cape Town Stadium.
Da Gama has also recently had his fair share of opinions about match referees, most notably against Orlando Pirates this week, when the Bucs clinched a 1-0 win, despite the goal being off side.
Now, it remains to be seen what will become of the aforementioned coaches and whether the PSL are set to issue a further statement in the new week.
