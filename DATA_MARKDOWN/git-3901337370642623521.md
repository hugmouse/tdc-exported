Not only did Zimbabwean defender Teenage Hadebe change his team, in moving to Turkey, he has also had a fashion glow up on his European journey.
 We take a look at his dramatic fashion transformation since leaving Amakhosi.
The 23-year-old’s stellar performances for the Warriors at the AFCON in Egypt secured him a move to Turkish side Malatyaspor.

 It’s been a few months since Hadebe left Mzansi’s shores, and since then has a had a major wardrobe turn-around.
 It seems as though he he has traded in the Relay and RedBat for Louis Vuitton and Gucci ensembles, and his Jordans for Cristian Louboutin Red Bottoms. He even has designer luggage for his travels!
