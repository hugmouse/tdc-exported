        Microsoft Japan carried out a “Working Reform Project” called the Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019, offering 2,300 employees every Friday off during the month – and saw a record boost in productivity.
      
For one month last August, the company implemented a three-day weekend every week, calling the Fridays “special paid vacation” that did not come at the expense of any other vacation time – and the results turned out to be incredible.
According to the company, the employees took 25.4 percent fewer days off during the month, printed 58.7 percent fewer pages, and used 23.1 percent less electricity in the office, saving money for the company.
The productivity went up by a staggering 39.9 percent, meaning that even though the employees were at work for less time,they got more work done.
