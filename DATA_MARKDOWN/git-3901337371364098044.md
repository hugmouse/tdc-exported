Kgotso Moleko is a marauding right back, who plies his trade for Kaizer Chiefs. Off the field, he is a game stock farmer who drives an impressive Mercedes-Benz and a bakkie valued at well over R1 million.
The 30-year-old has played a bit-part role for Ernst Middendorp’s team this season as he plays second fiddle to the likes of Reeve Frosler and Njabulo Blom.
Off the field, Moleko likes to get his hands dirty on his farm.

The former Bloemfontein Celtic man does not mind showing off his impressive rides which includes the luxurious Mercedes-Benz A-Class range.
Moleko drives the A200 AMG, which is valued at around R527 512.
He also boasts the newly acquired Toyota Hilux SC 28 GD6 RB Legend 50 MT 2.8, which according to Toyota’s website is valued at the R578 800 mark.
Before that, he got around in a Toyota WildTrak bakkie.

        Having not featured much for Amakhosi this season, do you think Moleko has what it takes to usurp Frosler & Co?
