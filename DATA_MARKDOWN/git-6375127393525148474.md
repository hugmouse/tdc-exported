“To dispel all doubts on the sincerity of the Chief Executive’s offer, as well as to put a halt to the discordant pessimism of the opposition, the President renews his offer to the Vice President to become the anti-illegal drugs czar, with all offices, bureaus, agencies or government instrumentalities involved in the enforcement of the law on prohibited drugs placed under her command and supervision with a Cabinet Secretary portfolio, to ensure her effectiveness in combating the drug menace,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement.
Panelo said Duterte is again making the offer after “critics and detractors of this Administration described the President’s gesture as a trap, arguing that it is impossible for VP Leni to solve the social problem with a limited period of six months and without the support of anti-drug bureaus and agencies.”
“The Office of the President wishes to be categorical – and contrary to the claim of critics and detractors of this Administration, we want VP Leni to succeed, her success being ultimately a triumph of the Filipino people against the dreaded and destructive evil that is destroying the basic fabric of our society,” he said.
