Robert Preston is set to be involved in a car crash which will expose his secret double life.
In jaw-dropping Coronation Street scenes this Christmas, the chef - and owner - of the Bistro, will see his life come crashing down.
The restaurateur, played by Tristan Gemmill, has been living a double life in the ITV soap, as he juggles fiancée Michelle Connor and his secret fiancée, Vicky, who is also pregnant with his child.
It will all come to a head when he is involved in a horrific car crash and taken to hospital.
In some of the most explosive scenes of the year in Weatherfield, both Robert's lovers will make a beeline for his bedside, to find that they are not the only ones betrothed to the two-timing cheat.
A soap source has told  The Sun Online  that Robert will be "speeding in Michelle’s car when he crashes into a lorry."
The crash will be just the start of Robert's problems as "both his fiancées Michelle and Vicky will be terrified when they hear of what’s happened."
They will both "head to the hospital to be with him."
 
The storyline could see the end of all those involved, as Tristan and Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle, have confirmed they are leaving the soap this year.
Kerri Quinn, who plays Vicky, has also revealed that she is set to quit the soap when this storyline reaches its conclusion.

        *Coronation Street continues at 7:30pm on ITV on Wednesday
