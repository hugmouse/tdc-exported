CARS, cash, documents and electronic devices have been seized in Co Monaghan as part of a Criminal Assets Bureau probe into international smuggling.
The probe is investigating the finances of haulage companies along the border.
A total of seven homes and three yards or industrial sheds were searched in the county earlier today.
Among the items seized were four high-performance cars and cash sums of euro, sterling and dollars worth €1,400, £600 and $900 respectively.
No one was arrested.
On Tuesday, a lorry tractor registered in the north, a lorry trailer registered in Bulgaria and a trailer were seized at Dublin port.
The Criminal Assets Bureau said the searches are not linked to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants found in a lorry container in Essex last week.
A CAB spokesman said: “For over a year, the Criminal Assets Bureau has, in accordance with its statutory remit, been investigating a group suspected of being involved in various international smuggling activities. That investigation has intensified over the past two weeks.”
