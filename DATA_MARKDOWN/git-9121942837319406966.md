YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) — Kyle Vantrease ran for two touchdowns and passed for another in a 27-point second quarter and the Buffalo defense overwhelmed Eastern Michigan in a 43-14 win on Saturday.
The Bulls (5-4, 3-2 Mid-American Conference) scored 43 straight points after the Eagles (4-5, 1-4) scored the opening touchdown on an 80-yard pass play from Mike Glass to Mathew Sexton.
Vantrease completed 15 of 23 passes for 208 yards with a 10-yard touchdown connection with Antonio Nunn in the closing seconds of the first half. The quarterback also added scores on runs of 16 and 1 yard.
James Patterson had 160 yards and two second-half touchdowns and Kevin Marks added a touchdown and 90 yards to become the 12th Bull to surpass 1,500 yards rushing.
Buffalo, which won its third straight, ended up with 460 yards, 252 on the ground while holding Eastern Michigan to 210 yards, just 25 rushing. The difference in first downs was 26-6 and the Bulls held the ball for 41½ minutes. Buffalo had five sacks, giving it 18 in the last four games, while allowing just one.
