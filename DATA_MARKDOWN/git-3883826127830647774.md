        A BMW convertible was stopped by police after it was spotted being used to transport a double bed.
      
A picture posted online by Essex Police shows the roof down and a mattress and bed frame upright on the back seat.
Officers on patrol stopped the vehicle at Great Bentley near Colchester and wrote about the "insecure load" on Twitter.
Using the face palm emoji, they said the female driver had told them "it's wedged in the seat so it's okay".
Other Twitter users responded in disbelief, calling it "beyond a joke" and "absolutely baffling".
