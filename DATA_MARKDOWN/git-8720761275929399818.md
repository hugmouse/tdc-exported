Google announced this morning that it has entered an agreement to buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion. In a blog post, Google's Senior Vice President of Devices & Services, Rick Osterloh, said the company sees "an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market." He added, "Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created engaging products, experiences and a vibrant community of users. By working closely with Fitbit's team of experts, and bringing together the best AI, software and hardware, we can help spur innovation in wearables and build products to benefit even more people around the world." From a report: Google's Wear OS wearable platform has been in something of a rut for the last few years. The company introduced the Android Wear to Wear OS rebrand in 2018 to revitalize its branding/image, but the hardware offerings have still been pretty ho-hum. Third-party watches like the Fossil Gen 5 have proven to be quite good, but without a proper "Made by Google" smartwatch and other major players, such as Samsung, ignoring the platform, it's been left to just sort of exist.
