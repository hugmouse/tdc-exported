        After finishing both sessions on Friday at the Circuit of the Americas well outside the top 10, McLaren rookie Lando Norris has admitted himself and the Woking-based side have their work cut out for them ahead of the rest of the weekend.
      
The 19-year-old finished FP1 down in 18th and FP2 in 14th, although the first session was predominantly used to test out the new tyres for the 2020 season.
The rookie, who completed FP1 for McLaren at COTA in 2018 when he was still an F2 driver, is coming off the back of a very frustrating weekend in Mexico, where he lost a promising result by a nightmare pitstop which ended up losing him over two minutes.
At the cold and windy COTA, Norris wasn't overly pleased with his running on Friday, although he does know where and how to improve for the rest of the weekend.
“A tricky day with all the bumps which are worse than last year, making it easy to snatch a front wheel and have a small lock-up," the Brit analysed.

        "But after today, we have a direction to push in for tomorrow.
      

        “We’re there or thereabouts on pace, but it’s very close. So, it’s going to be more about putting the lap together and seeing how we get on, but we’ve got a bit of work to do.”
