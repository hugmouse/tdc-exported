During last week's BlizzCon 2019 event, Blizzard Entertainment revealed the existence of Overwatch 2, which will see the now-famous roster of misfit heroes continue their payload-pushing adventures into a new title, bringing new modes, maps, abilities and characters to the popular multiplayer universe.But it looks like those eager to dive back into all of this new content will have quite some time to wait, as Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan has clarified that even a rudimentary release window is yet to be decided upon. "I don't know. I have no idea," Kaplan responded when asked for a possible date by PC Gamer. "Like, just let us make it great, that's what we care about more than anything. We don't have a date in mind." Kaplan also noted that the team was expected to go very quiet once BlizzCon was over, in order to concentrate on the development of the sequel.While it's obviously still early days in the information drip-feed of Overwatch 2. I'm struggling to see it as a fully-fledged "sequel." Given that it seems all of the characters, maps, modes and, thankfully, unlocks will carry over. I still just get a "Super Ultra Overwatch" vibe from all of this, also borne out in the fact players from both titles will still be able to play together - not that I'm suggesting that is a bad thing, of course.Overwatch 2 is currently in development at Blizzard Entertainment.'I have no idea' when Overwatch 2 will be out, Jeff Kaplan says [PC Gamer]
