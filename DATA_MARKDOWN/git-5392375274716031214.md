Finnish manufacturer, HMD Global, seems to be preparing a successor to the recently released Nokia 2.2. According to a distributor database, Nokia is preparing a new smartphone – Nokia 2.3. The name of this device suggests that it is the successor to the Nokia 2.2. The Distributor database shows that the Nokia 2.3 smartphone comes with model number “TA-1206”. In addition, it will be available in three colours which include “Sand”, “Cyan Green” and “Charcoal” (maybe brown, turquoise or black). Nokia 7.2 was the first Nokia phone to leak in the Distributor database, and the leak information was very reliable.
As of now, there is no information on the configuration of the Nokia 2.3. However, there are speculations that it should come with MediaTek’s Helio A22, and Bluetooth may use 5.0. Generally, the specifications of this device should be similar to Nokia 2.2.
Nokia 2.2 comes with a 5.71-inch HD+ resolution display. It is powered by a MediaTek Helio A22 processor SoC coupled with 2GB or 3GB of RAM and 16GB or 32GB of expandable internal storage. Other aspects include a 3,000 mAh battery, 5W MicroUSB charging, 13MP f/2.2 rear camera, 5MP front camera which supports face unlock and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Nokia 2.2 is an Android One product and it sells for about $110.
