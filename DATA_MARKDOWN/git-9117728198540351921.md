        Pete Bonnington missed Lewis Hamilton's latest victory at the Mexican Grand Prix but he'll be back reassuring Hamilton this weekend at the US Grand Prix.
      
Bonnington missed Hamilton's win at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as he underwent a personal medical procedure. He was a doubt for the US Grand Prix and was expected to return at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but he has made a speedy recovery and will be back for the race at the Circuit of the Americas. Marcus Dudley filled in for Bonno at the Mexican Grand Prix.
Hamilton can clinch his sixth World Championship this weekend having missed the chance to seal it at the Mexican Grand Prix. Any finish higher than eighth will see him crowned World Champion again.
