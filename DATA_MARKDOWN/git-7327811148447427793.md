RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (WABC) -- Macy's newest balloon stars took center stage Saturday during their outdoor test flights at Macy's Balloonfest, in preparation for the 93rd Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
New giant balloons include Astronaut Snoopy, Netflix's Green Eggs and Ham, and SpongeBob SquarePants and pal Gary.
New heritage balloons include Smokey Bear and world-renowned contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama's "Love Flies Up to the Sky."
Each year Macy's welcomes new and beloved characters from entertainment and pop culture.
At Macy's Balloonfest, the parade's newest balloons are expertly test flown under the direction of Macy's highly skilled flight management team.
Along with a few hundred handlers, the team took the balloons out for an outdoor trial run to get firsthand experience flying the new stars ahead of their Thanksgiving Day debuts.
The Balloonfest took place at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
