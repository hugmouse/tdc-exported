LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jonah Antonio and Cheikh Mbacke Diong each scored 17 points, UNLV had five players score in double figures and T.J. Otzelberger won his debut as head coach 86-71 against Purdue-Fort Wayne Tuesday night.
Antonio drained five of UNLV’s seven 3-pointers. Donnie Tillman added 16 points, Amauri Hardy scored 15 with six assists and Elijah Mitrou-Long scored 11 and also dished six assists.
The Runnin’ Rebels scored 42 points in the paint and had 11 second-chance points with a 43-19 advantage on the glass. UNLV also scored 19 points off 11 Purdue-Fort Wayne turnovers.
The Mastodons were led by Jarred Godfrey with 23 points on 10-for-17 shooting.
A 3-pointer from the Mastodons’ Brian Patrick briefly cut the lead to nine points midway through the second half. UNLV’s Tillman threw down a dunk at the other end that sparked a 9-0 run with Hardy scoring on a fast break after a Fort Wayne turnover. Mitrou-Long added a layup and a steal and Bryce Hamilton converted a three-point play in the two-minute outburst.
