Definitive David Moyes has dismissed any chance of returning to Scotland to manage either Hibs or Hearts.
The former Manchester United and Everton boss had been linked with the vacant Tynecastle job and was in the betting after the Easter Road side sacked Paul Heckingbottom on Monday.
Moyes wouldn’t close the door on a return to Scotland, although it is likely that it would have to be the Celtic job as it won't be to either Hibs or Hearts .
The 56-year-old, speaking to BBC Scotland, said: “Neither job would be of any interest me to.
“I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t move back to Scotland. 
“Scotland is my love and Glasgow is where I am from. 
“Hopefully, someday I will be back.  At the moment it is not for just now.”
 
Moyes has been out of football since he left West Ham last year. He has also managed Sunderland, Preston and Real Sociedad.
He also ruled himself out of the Scotland running before Steve Clarke got the job.
