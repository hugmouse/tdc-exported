PESHAWAR: The Cyber Crime Wing of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has arrested Muhammad Usman, a resident of Dera Ismail Khan for allegedly harassing a woman while using an ‘illegal’ mobile number bought on a Whatsapp group.
Officials said that the suspect had bought a SIM — which had been issued in the name of an Okara resident — and then used it to purchase foreign mobile numbers for use on Whatsapp. This way, he could conceal his true identity in the group. However, on the complaint of the harassment victim, the FIA registered a FIR against the suspect at the FIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre in DI Khan.
