Google has decided to add the "Close other tabs" right-click context menu option back to Google Chrome. While it is not known why they decided to add it back, it was a missed feature and adding it back is a welcome change.
With the release of Chrome 78, Google removed right-click tab context-menu options whose functionality could be achieved by other means.
Unfortunately, this led to the removal of the very popular "Close other tabs" option as well the 'New tab', 'Reopen closed tab', and 'Bookmark all tabs' menu options.
In a rare move, a new code commit shows that Google has rolled back their decision and is adding the "Close other tabs" context menu option back to Chrome. 
It is currently not known in what version of Chrome this feature will be added back, but as the code change is brand new it is not in the Chrome Canary build as of yet.
Unfortunately, for those who use the other removed context menu options, it does not appear that Google will be adding those back at this time.
