Watford are winless after 10 league games, and in danger of losing touch in the relegation battle – so the visit of a Chelsea side who have won every away game since losing at Old Trafford on opening day is far from ideal. Frank Lampard has warned his team against complacency, and has a selection dilemma up front after Christian Pulisic’s hat-trick against Burnley. Antonio Rüdiger is unavailable, while the match also comes too soon for Ross Barkley and N’Golo Kanté. Quique Sánchez Flores has called on the home fans to make plenty of noise at Vicarage Road on Saturday. Watford’s 4-1 win in this fixture last season is a sign of what they are capable of doing to top-six sides that underestimate them. Niall McVeigh
