The Excise Duty Regulations, 2019 proposes harsh measures for the production of excisable goods such as beer, tobacco, and juices in what is aimed at sealing revenue leakages.
Under the VAT (Electronic Tax Invoice) Regulations, 2019 Treasury wants traders to record daily sales and provide Electronic Tax Register receipts to the taxman.
This means all business owners will be required to incorporate an ETR into their operations if the proposal by Treasury is passed.
