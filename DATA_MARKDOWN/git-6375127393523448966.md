PRC chairman and CEO Senator Richard J. Gordon said PRC’s army of volunteers and staff rushed to treat injured patients and are continuously assisting affected individuals, especially those in badly hit areas in North Cotabato and Davao del Sur.    
“We are all in this together. Since the first earthquake struck Mindanao on Oct. 16, our team has been working round-the-clock, providing first aid and other humanitarian services like distribution of hot meals to the affected residents, such as those in Balabag Barangay Hall in Kidapawan City, North Cotabato which serves as temporary evacuation center for 400 affected individuals,” he said.
Gordon added that the  PRC deployed eight teams consisting of two from North Cotabato, one from Davao del Sur, two from South Cotabato, one from General Santos City and two from National Headquarters to conduct assessments and augment the chapters’ operations in different areas of Mindanao.
North Cotabato Chapter sent teams to assess the situation in Kidapawan City and Barangay Ilomavis while volunteers and staff from Davao del Sur set up a temporary station and also deployed a team to conduct an assessment within the vicinity of their area.
