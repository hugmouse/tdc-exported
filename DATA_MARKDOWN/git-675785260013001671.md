Zayn Malik's sister has announced she is expecting her first baby one month after getting married.
17-year-old Safaa tied the knot with boyfriend Martin Tise in a traditional Nikah ceremony in her hometown of Bradford in September.
Today the six form student confirmed news of her pregnancy on Instagram with a photograph of her showing off her blossoming baby bump in a fitted pink dress.
Safaa then shared more pictures from her gender reveal party as she discovered she's expecting a daughter with husband Martin.
Safaa married Martin three days after her 17th birthday in September.
The event was documented on social media by One Direction star Zayn's mum Trisha with snaps of the special day which she captioned: “My baby girls big day.”
However, Zayn did not attend his little sister's wedding.
Trisha's gallery of images showed the newlyweds cutting the cake as well as different family members – including Zayn's sisters Doniya and Waliyha, both 28, and their father Yaser – posing with the bride.
Zayn is based in the US but supports his family financially.
The Pillow Talk singer brought them a house and even pays his mum Trisha a wage.
