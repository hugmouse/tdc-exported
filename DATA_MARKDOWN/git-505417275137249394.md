        Irish U21 international Conor Coventry could be on his way out of West Ham United in January as he is reportedly unhappy with the terms of a potential contract extension.
      
Coventry has been with The Hammers since he was 10 years of age but according to a report in The Guardian he may leave in January if he does not get the appropriate contract extension.
The report also outlines that the 19-year-old is attracting interest from a host of different clubs with West Ham fearing his exit in the transfer window.
Coventry has been crucial to West Ham’s U23s’ Premier League 2 success so far this season, leading the squad to an unbeaten first half of their league campaign, as well as making his second senior West Ham appearance in the Carabao Cup earlier this season.
He has also been an integral part of Stephen Kenny’s U21 side since the former Dundalk boss took over and was again named in the squad for their upcoming qualifiers against Armenia and Sweden.
The 19-year-old was named man-of-the-match in Ireland’s draw with Italy last month and alongside Jayson Molumby he has formed a strong partnership in the heart of Kenny’s midfield.
Despite his success with the Irish U21s Coventry has found chances in the West Ham first team hard to come by this year – save for his cup cameo – and could feel it is the right time to leave the club.
