Kaizer Chiefs star winger Khama Billiat has opened up on his alleged beef with Orlando Pirates star Thembinkosi Lorch.
Speaking to the media at the Killarney Country Club ahead of their Absa Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates, the Zimbabwean shed some light on the incident where Lorch innocuously stepped on him.

“We don’t have any beef. It happens in big games where emotions run high and things are done in the heat of the moment. I know this because I also do some crazy stuff at times.”
When asked if he thought Lorch’s actions were deliberate, the 29-year-old revealed that the duo spoke about the incident. 
“We are cool, we spoke about it after the game. I don’t think his actions were deliberate. Orlando Pirates are a big team with quality players, I don’t think they will target me.”
Billiat & Co will be hoping to get one over their arch-rivals as the two sides lock horns for the second time in seven days.
