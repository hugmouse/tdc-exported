Brendan Rodgers is interested in Club Brugge’s £20million-rated frontman Emmanuel Dennis.
The Leicester boss is hunting January reinforcements as the third-placed Foxes look to consolidate their position in the Champions League places.
Dennis, 21, has three goals in nine league games for Brugge this season and has attracted a string of admirers. He also scored twice against Real Madrid in the Champions League last month.
Dennis is thought to be seen as potential competition for Jamie Vardy is the current top scorer in the Premier League this season on 10.
Rodgers is also keen on Real Sociedad defender Diego Llorente.
The 26-year-old joined La Real two summers ago in a £5m deal from Real Madrid. West Ham and Spurs are among the clubs to have tracked him since then.
Llorente has a release clause of £45m, but Sociedad are understood not to be under any financial pressure to sell.
Leicester have won seven of their 11 league games this season and are just two points behind second-placed Manchester City .
