        Terminator: Dark Fate, another movie in a long series of attempts to bring the franchise back to life, bombed this weekend - for the third time in a decade, despite the return of its creator James Cameron as a producer and Linda Hamilton as its star.
      
The sixth movie in the franchise brought in an estimated $29 million over the weekend at the domestic box office – with its budget of $180 million, which won the weekend box office but is below the high $30 million to low $40 million projected opening the industry had for it. The result is comparable to 2015's "Terminator Genisys," which opened at $27 million over the July 4th weekend. The latest instalment of the Terminator franchise is also opening with just $28 million in China, which is still more than the $26.9 million opening day of Terminator: Genisys. 
Despite the focus on Hamilton and an all-new women cast instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s iconic and never-changing T-800 role, the film still failed to attract an audience. “Dark Fate” was reportedly plagued with production issues, including a bloated budget, script problems, creative battles between Cameron and director Tim Miller (“Deadpool”) and a set that went dark for days.
“Dark Fate” earned mixed reviews with a B-plus CinemaScore and a 69% “fresh” score on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, proving that the general audience is just tired of “Terminator” movies and does not care about them much anymore.
