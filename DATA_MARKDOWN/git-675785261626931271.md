A woman who claims staff threatened to kick her off a flight over her choice of clothes and acting 'disrespectfully' with her boyfriend says she is the victim of 's**t shaming'.
Serah Nathan was flying home to Melbourne from Sydney on Sunday after visiting her boyfriend, with whom she is in a long-distance relationship with.
Knowing they wouldn't see each other again until Christmas, Serah sat on her boyfriend's knee 'talking about mundane nothingness' while waiting for the flight when she claims she was approached by groundstaff.
The 33-year-old says a representative of the airline Jetstar approached them and told her to sit on a separate seat 'because there are children watching', as reported by news.com.au .
 
After asking her to clarify why she couldn't sit on her partner's lap, she says she was told 'you're disrespecting the parents here'.
"I wasn’t treating a domestic airport terminal like a strip club," said Serah, who claims felt 's**t shamed' and believes she was targeted because of her half Sri Lankan nationality.
"(The Jetstar employee) alleged my full length trackies, runners and crop top combo might get me refused on a flight.
 
“I noted the caucasian woman sitting opposite me wore a very short strapless dress but was left to her own devices."
Jetstar denied any discriminatory behaviour and said 'our teams dispute allegations they were acting in this way'.
Serah, who says she was left 'shocked and humiliated' by the situation, said the behaviour continued when she arrived home and contacted the customer service team to discuss what had happened.
 
Having provided an account of what happened and an image of her outfit that day to discuss if it was 'inappropriate' to fly, she says a member of the online chat team told her 'I think you are very beautiful' and that her boyfriend must be 'very lucky to have you'.
After an investigation, the airline concluded they didn't think it was 'appropriate' for Serah to sit on her boyfriend's knee and 'believe that this kind of body language must be done in a private place'.
A spokesperson for Jetstar said an investigation is on-going.
“We are speaking to our airport team to better understand what happened," Jetstar said in a statement.
"We apologise to Serah for the manner in which her query was handled by our online customer service representative which fell well short of the standards we expect."
