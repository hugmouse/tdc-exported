Britain's national terrorism threat level has been lowered to "substantial" from "severe".
Home Secretary Priti Patel announced the move today.
She said in a statement: "Despite the change in the threat level, terrorism remains one of the most direct and immediate risks to our national security."
The "substantial" threat level continued to indicate a high level of threat and an attack might well occur without further warning, she said.
