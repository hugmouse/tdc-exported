Israel has launched a series of raids targeting various locations in the Gaza Strip. The attacks came in response to a rocket barrage fired earlier from the Strip into Israeli towns and settlements.The Palestinian Ministry of Health said Ahmed al-Shehri, 27, was killed during pre-dawn attacks on areas west of Khan Younis on Saturday.Two other Palestinians sustained moderate or serious shrapnel wounds from one of the strikes, according to the ministry.The rockets and raids were launched one day after new clashes erupted as part of the “March of Return” demonstrations near the Strip's border with Israel.They resulted in wounding more than 90 Palestinians on Friday, including 50 with bullets, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.“Israeli warplanes attacked a wide array of targets, including a military compound belonging to the naval forces of Hamas group, a military compound belonging to the organization’s air defense system, a missile simulator, training facilities, an arms manufacturing site, and a military compound used as a weapons storehouse,” the army said in a statement.Ten rockets were fired into Israel in two separate barrages on Friday night, the army noted, adding that one projectile slammed into a house in the town of Sderot, while the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted eight other rockets.This was the second night in a row that rockets were fired from the Strip into Israeli territory, following a six-week truce.The videos released by the army showed the moment of bombing sites in the Strip in open lands.The Israeli army held Hamas accountable for the rocket fire from Gaza, while Hamas responded that the Israeli bombardment was a serious escalation against innocent civilians and would retaliate against the occupation.Israel routinely holds Gaza’s Hamas rulers responsible for any violence emanating from the Strip.
