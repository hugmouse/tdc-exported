The Chase viewers were left speechless today - after discovering a contestant's real age.
Those flocking to watch the ITV1 daytime show subsequently took to social media to have their say.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with comments from baffled fans as the quiz favourite played out.
The show, presented by Bradley Walsh, a former Coronation Street star, saw four contestants compete for a life-changing sum of money.
Among them was Owen, from London, who was on the show in a bid to beast Mark Labbett, also known as the Beast.
Owen from London shocked viewers when he revealed his age.
The curricular manager told host Bradley Walsh he is 40 years old.
 
And many viewers took to Twitter to share their amazement, according to the Liverpool Echo .
Polly said: "Owen looks wonderful for 40!", followed by a heart-eyes emoji.
Andi tweeted: "Owen's 40 he looks like Guy's older brother by a few years."
Another viewer wrote: "Owen does not look 40."
Owen had a great cash-builder round, securing a solid £8000 - however he was not tempted by The Beast's high offer of £35k.
The head-to-head round was tight, but Owen managed to make it through to the final chase.
 
However, it wasn't meant to be as Mark won the round with three seconds to go.
