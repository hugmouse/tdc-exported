Lionel Scaloni's side will lock horns with the Selecao and Uruguay this month, friendlies for which captain Messi has returned after serving a three-month suspension.
Paris Saint-Germain winger Di Maria was once again overlooked for the squad, despite his incredible form for his club so far this season. His teammate Mauro Icardi will also play no part in the Albiceleste's friendlies.
Since the 2019 Copa America, Argentina are unbeaten in four matches, having drawn to both Chile and Germany, and beaten Mexico and Ecuador.
