WASHINGTON: U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Friday the Medicare for All system she backs would cost the U.S. government an extra US$20.5 trillion over 10 years but would not "require raising taxes one penny" on the middle class.
Instead, she said, it would save American households US$11 trillion in current out-of-pocket spending.
"Health care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values," the Democratic presidential candidate wrote in a 20-page essay outlining her plan that will be published on the website Medium. "That system is Medicare for All."
