Last week during its six months earnings report, Nintendo hinted it would no longer develop first-party games for the 3DS. From here on out, the plan is to rely on evergreen titles to sustain system sales.
In terms of technical support for the system itself – nothing has changed. In fact, yesterday, a new system update was rolled out. This new firmware update – Version 11.12.0-44 – is the same as always:
To manually update your 3DS, head over to the System Settings within the device, select System Update from within the menu and then tap OK to begin.
