ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A new report says Federal Aviation Administration errors contributed to the crash of a floatplane in Alaska.
The Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday that the National Transportation Safety Board report criticizes FAA oversight of the company operating the July 2018 flight.
There were no deaths when the de Havilland Otter owned by Taquan Air crashed into Mount Bradley in Juneau.
Six passengers were seriously hurt and four sustained minor injuries on the flight originating at Prince of Wales Island.
The report says the FAA allowed Taquan to keep an operations director who was at times too busy to oversee flight safety due to another aviation job.
An FAA spokesman said Thursday that the agency could not immediately respond to questions about the report it had just received.
