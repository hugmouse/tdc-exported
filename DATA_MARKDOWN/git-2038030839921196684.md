Cape Town - Idols SA judge Unathi shared a video on Instagram, showing the extensive damage to her car after it was keyed.
Unathi explains that when she returned to her vehicle after a session at the gym, she discovered that someone had scratched the side of her car. 
"There is so much hate in the world," she says while moving the camera over the damage. "Why are you so mad, though," she asks.
The singer did not let the incident cast a grey cloud over her day, and wrote in the comment section: "Happy Monday depressed one. Thank you for making me know I defeat you." She ended the post with the lips and laughing face emoji. 
Celebrity friends jumped in the comment section to express their shock at what had happened. 
"Hectic," wrote Pearl Thusi and Ntando Duma said: "T for tense!"
Relebogile Mabotja agreed with Unathi's sentiment, saying: "People are broken."
