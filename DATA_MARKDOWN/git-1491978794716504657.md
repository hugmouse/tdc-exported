        Autopsy has revealed cause of Briton’s death, according to Preah Sihanouk governor
      
An autopsy has determined that a British backpacker whose body was found at sea a week after she disappeared died from drowning, according to a Cambodian official.
The governor of Preah Sihanouk province said the body of Amelia Bambridge was examined at the main hospital in Sihanoukville, where it was taken after being found on Thursday in the Gulf of Thailand.
Bambridge, 21, disappeared after attending a beach party on the night of 23 October on the island of Koh Rong. Her body was discovered by fishermen about 60miles (96km) away.
The provincial police chief earlier said the autopsy would be attended by forensic police, a hospital doctor, a court prosecutor, a representative of the British embassy and members of Bambridge’s family.
