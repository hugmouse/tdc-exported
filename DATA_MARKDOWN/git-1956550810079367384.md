Le Petite Prince – or The Little Prince for the non-linguists among us – is coming to the UAE.The childrens' book written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry that was published in both English and French in 1940, has been adapted for the stage and is heading to Dubai Opera in January.But the classic story is coming with a twist – a circus twist to be precise.While The Little Prince has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera, this modern take is being told through contemporary dance and acrobatic movement.Add video mapping technology, audiovisual poetic immersion, stunning choreography, aerial straps, video projection and flying poles (phew) into the mix and you've got a serious spectacle lined up.This is the story of a grown-up meeting his inner child, embodied by a Little Prince.Coming through the clouds, an aviator lands his plane in the middle of the desert and meets the Little Prince walking on a sphere, flying from one planet to another, and looking for his sheep.An omnipresent narrator accompanies the Little Prince on a journey filled with amazing characters he meets along the way.Tickets are on sale at www.dubaiopera.com, with prices for each show available from Dhs275.
