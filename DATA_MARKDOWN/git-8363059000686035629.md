The giant faux sausage roll is in stores now, and only costs £1 somehow.
Since Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll (that did very well for the high street bakery), everyone else seems to have twigged that there's a juicy vegan pie out there and they want a slice, with Tesco, Aldi following suit, and now Morrisons is upping the ante with a footlong vegan sausage roll that you can pick up from its Pie Counters, piping hot and ready to chow down on.
The supermarket already has regular-sized vegan sausage rolls, and introduced a meaty footlong sausage roll in 2017 which also had a price tag of a quid. So now the two concepts have been married and their union has lead to the birth of a kickstart into obesity for vegans, so they don't feel left out.
"Our original foot long sausage roll caught the imagination of the nation so we’ve worked hard to make sure everyone – including vegans – can now tuck into our creation,’ says Steven Halford, Morrisons pie expert, adding "sharing is optional," so that you don't feel riddled with guilt when you're sitting at home later, covered in crumbs with hot fake sausage grease smeared all over your lips like poorly applied Vaseline.
