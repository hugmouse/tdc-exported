With Succession in between seasons and the accompanying meme deluge therefore at bay, now seems like a good time to remind everyone there’s another premium-cable show about very rich people, Billions, and it has just added a few great cast members for season five. Julianna Margulies and Corey Stoll will enter the world of Manhattan power brokers, with the multi-Emmy winner and former Good Wife star playing Catherine Brant, a bestselling author who teaches sociology at some Ivy, and Stoll in the part of Michael Prince, which is a perfect captain-of-industry name. Prince is described as a “business titan” who comes from a small town in Indiana, so maybe he’s got a chip on his shoulder about not coming up with the New York elites? We’ll see!
