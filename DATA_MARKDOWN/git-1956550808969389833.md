There is set to be a dry night in Dubai, and it’s due to fall on Friday November 8.
Dubai will be dry for the night from 5.30pm on Friday November 8 until 6.30pm on Saturday November 9.
This means that bars and restaurants across Dubai will not be serving anything other than soft drinks. There will also be no entertainment.
Other upcoming celebrations mean that public and private sector workers could enjoy a public holiday on Sunday December 1 for Commemoration Day and two days' holiday for UAE National Day on December 2 and 3.
So if you already get weekends off, it looks like you might be able to expect five days off at the end of November and beginning of December.
Follow Time Out Dubai for more details of upcoming holidays.
Dry night Fri Nov 8, 5.30pm-Sat Nov 9, 6.30pm.
