Topline: McDonald’s announced Monday that Global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst has left the fast food giant following the departure of CEO Steve Easterbrook, who was fired over the weekend for having a consensual relationship with an employee.
News peg: Over the weekend McDonald’s board of directors ousted Easterbrook, who is divorced, for having a consensual relationship with an employee, which violates company policy prohibiting relationships by managers with direct or indirect subordinates.
While romantic relationships between managers and employees relationships are not illegal, many companies have no-dating policies to avoid allegations of preferential treatment or lawsuits arising from unwanted advances or sexual harassment.
Key background: Easterbrook is credited with overhauling McDonald’s by renovating restaurants, acquiring an Israeli artificial intelligence startup and introducing eco-friendly policies. But the company has been the target of activists seeking a $15 minimum wage across the country, and McDonald’s HR department has been accused of failing to prevent sexual harassment at its restaurants. In response, the company, under Easterbrook, started a complaint hotline for front-line employees and revamped training. 
Tangent: Easterbrook, who took home nearly $16 million in executive pay last year, will get six months severance pay, the Wall Street Journal reported.
