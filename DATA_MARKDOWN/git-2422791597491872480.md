OTTAWA -- Statistics Canada says the country's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $978 million in September compared with a revised deficit of $1.2 billion in August.
Economists on average had expected a deficit of $700 million, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.
The deficit came as total imports fell 1.7 per cent to $50.8 billion in September.
Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products fell 9.2 per cent in September due to a drop in gold imports.
Meanwhile, total exports fell 1.3 per cent to $49.8 billion.
Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products fell 7.3 per cent, while exports of energy products dropped 2.6 per cent due to lower crude oil exports.
