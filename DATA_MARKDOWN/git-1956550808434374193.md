Sharjah has been named by UNESCO as a creative city for its crafts and folk art.The Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, added 66 cities to the list including Beirut in Lebanon for literature, Muharraq in Bahrain for design, and Essaouira in Morocco for music.Cities on the list commit to championing sustainable development that benefits communities at an urban level.Azoulay said, “All over the world, these cities, each in its way, make culture the pillar, not an accessory, of their strategy.“This favours political and social innovation and is particularly important for the young generations.”There are now 246 cities involved in the creative cities network that spans the globe. The cities come from different continents, income levels and populations.UNESCO says the cities “place creativity and the creative economy at the core of their urban development plans to make cities safe, resilient, inclusive and sustainable, in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”.The news comes after Sharjah was named World Book Capital in 2019. The emirate hosts an annual international book fair, and has launched libraries at a number of beaches.
