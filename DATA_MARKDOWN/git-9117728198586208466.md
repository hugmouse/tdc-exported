        Sergio Perez will start from the pitlane for the United States Grand Prix after he missed the weight check at the end of FP2 in Austin.
      
Having originally missed it the team carried out a practice pit stop before he returned for the weight check. Perez finished to the second practice session at the Circuit of the Americas in 15th place with a best time of 1:35.109.
After consulting footage and speaking with Perez and Racing Point the stewards made their decision to give the Mexican the mandatory pitlane start.
“The Stewards reviewed video evidence and heard from the driver of car 11 (Sergio Perez) and the team representative and determined that the driver failed to stop for weighing when required to do so," a statement read.

        “Instead, he drove on and proceeded to do a pit stop where the car was worked on by lifting the car and all four wheels were changed, in breach of Article 29.1 a). 
      

        "The penalty imposed is a mandatory penalty specified under the Formula One Sporting Regulations and the Stewards note that they have no discretion to impose an alternative penalty.”
