A man faces court today after being arrested on suspicion of setting light to a Mount Gould property with intent to endanger lives.
John Dangerfield, age 49, is set to appear at Plymouth Magistrates' Court today following his arrest on November 4.
He was arrested after firefighters were called to a suspicious fire at a property in Ladysmith Road at around 8.10am.
The road was closed to traffic for more than an hour as the emergency services carried out their work. Neighbouring properties were not affected or evacuated.
The fire is understood to have taken hold in the front room of the address. No-one was found inside the property and fire investigators, along with scene of crime officers, remained at the scene to establish the cause of the fire.
Dangerfield was later arrested and then charged on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.
He will appear at court sometime today.
Police are still appealing for any information about the matter and if you can assist investigators call them on 101, email them on 101@dc.police.uk  or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 quoting log number 131 of 4/11/2019
