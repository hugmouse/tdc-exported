Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan have worked together in many films. The duo shares a great bond and Karan's recent post on SRK's 54th birthday is proof of the same!
KJo took to his Instagram to share a series of old pictures of them clicked on the sets. Expressing how special SRK is and how the actor has influenced him, the filmmaker wrote, "Happy birthday Bhai @iamsrk.... Am not sure words are the best way to describe certain relationships...specially those that have such powerful silences...you have always been such a tremendous influence in my life! Like the best preacher teacher i have had the honour of calling my family...my journey with you will always be the best phase of my career and life and there is still so much more to come...thank you for being you...thank you for always being there for mom and me and now our little ones...thank you for being my fathers best friend and my older brother for life!!!
