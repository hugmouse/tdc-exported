It can now distribute internet signals, thanks to an order by the parish priest in the same area, the one who also called for the building of the monument, per Slavorum The community itself is purportedly not aware of the development, while the internet provider has stated that the priest wanted internet distribution to “monitor in the parish.” To capture a clearer picture of the statue’s crown, journalists had to deploy a drone, revealing images of visible antennas within the statue’s crown.

Meanwhile, the church did not give any comments to journalists. The antennas were found to be able to distribute the internet effectively due to the height of the statue. The whole statue, from the bottom to the top of Christ’s crown, measures up to 52.5 meters (172 feet) altogether. It is unclear how the locals are reacting to their internet browsing sessions being received by the statue of the Lord.
