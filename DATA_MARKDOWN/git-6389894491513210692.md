Nigel Farage has offered an olive branch to Boris Johnson by calling for a “leave alliance” with the Brexit Party in return for softening his Brexit position.
Farage launched the party’s campaign this morning, where he said the party planned to field candidates in every constituency in England, Wales and Scotland in next month’s election.
However, if Johnson, and other opposition MPs, agreed to a leave alliance he said the Brexit Party would stand aside in some seats.
Farage also said he would soften his Brexit and agree to a free trade agreement with the EU if an alliance was formed.
His current position is that the UK must go for a no-deal exit from the EU.
“Boris Johnson would win a very big majority and on that manifesto we really could get Brexit done,” he said.
“To quote a friend of mine [US President Donald Trump], we’d become an ‘unstoppable force’.” 

        More to come.
