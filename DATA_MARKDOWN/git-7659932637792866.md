Iran's supreme leader on Sunday again ruled out negotiations with Washington, describing the two countries as implacable foes a day before the 40th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran."Those who see negotiations with the US as the solution to every problem are certainly mistaken," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a speech to mark the anniversary, according to his official website."One way to block America's political infiltration is to ban any talks with America. It means Iran will not yield to America's pressure," he was quoted by state TV as saying, Reuters reported.Relations between the two countries have reached a crisis over the past year after US President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 pact between Iran and world powers under which Tehran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for lifting sanctions.Washington has reimposed sanctions aimed at halting all Iranian oil exports, saying it seeks to force Iran to negotiate to reach a wider deal. Khamenei has banned Iranian officials from holding such talks unless the US returns to the nuclear deal and lifts all sanctions.He also criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for trying to promote talks between Washington and Tehran. According to Reuters, Macron tried to arrange a failed meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September.
