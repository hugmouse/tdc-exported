Sky has announced the creation of 1,000 new jobs across the UK, raising the firm's total number of UK and Ireland employees by nearly 5%.
The broadcasting giant said on Monday it will open a new customer contact centre in Leeds to meet increased customer demand, hiring 500 new customer service representatives.
It will also hire 500 new engineers as part of the roll-out of its newest TV platform Sky Q.
Sky already employs 3,500 engineers across the UK and 1,000 more people who are based in Leeds, with the majority working in the brand's technology hub.
The newly announced roles brings the total number of employees in the UK and Ireland to 25,000.
Perks include: "Sky Q, a generous pension and private health care. Access to over 12,000 LinkedIn Learning courses to support your development. And if that’s not enough, our Leeds Dock campus offers a pool table, table tennis, discounted gym membership, endless local discounts, and much more."
Sky provides satellite TV, broadband and phone services as well as its own streaming service, NOW TV, in addition to the hybrid HD service Sky Q.
 
Sky UK and Ireland chief executive Stephen van Rooyen said: "It's great that 500 new Sky engineers will be hitting the roads right across the UK this winter to meet growing customer demand.
"Together with our expanded team in Leeds, these 1,000 new employees are a real testament to Sky's commitment to customer service and investment to create a diverse workforce right across the UK."
