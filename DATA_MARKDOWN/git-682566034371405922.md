Cape Town - Serena Williams needs to play in more tournaments in preparation for the Grand Slams, according to former WTA star Daniela Hantuchova.
The 2019 campaign has been another case of so close, but yet so far for Williams in terms of equalling Margaret Court's all-time major record of 24.
The 23-time Grand Slam winner reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals again, but came up short against Simona Halep at SW19 and Bianca Andreescu at Flushing Meadows.
Williams has played a reduced schedule since returning to action following the birth of her daughter, but Hantuchova feels she should add a few more events to her calendar.
"I do hope it happens for her, as a reward for the champion she is," she told the New York Times.
"But I do believe she should play a few extra tournaments to be able to handle those finals better and so things can come automatically in the big moments."
