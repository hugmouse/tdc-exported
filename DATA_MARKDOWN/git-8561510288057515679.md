For the past week, the tech press has been breathlessly obsessing over Apple’s AirPods Pro, the latest version of its wireless-earbud-slash-status -symbol.
Here at Futurism, we honestly can’t be bothered with a new version of the awful, unserviceable gadget. But we couldn’t help but admire this fully functional, hammer-sized Bluetooth AirPod built by handy Redditor Master_Aar17.
Seriously, just look at it:
Master_Aar17 even posted a video of the colossal earbud playing the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun,” along with schematics of the novelty-sized gadget.
Unfortunately, though, Master_Aar17 said he has no plans to bring the gigantic earpiece to market.
“Sadly I can’t sell it because Apple would get pissed,” the Redditor wrote, “but yeah several people have asked if it’s available for purchase.”
