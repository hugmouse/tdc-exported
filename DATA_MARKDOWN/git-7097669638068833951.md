Multiple people have been shot after a shooting at Halloween party in California, according to local media.
Officials in Orinda, northeast of San Francisco, said they were investigating a “multiple shooting”.
“Orinda Police Department and Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff are working a multiple shooting in Orinda. Investigation is active. Details coming later,” said the county sheriff’s office on Twitter.
NBC reported that the shooting took place during a Halloween party at a rented Airbnb property.
The attack was called in between 11pm and midnight, reports said.
A number of people were loaded into ambulances, according to the local ABC affiliate, while further victims appeared to be walking wounded.
The mass shooting comes just days after three people were killed and another nine wounded in a similar shooting in Long Beach. The scene there was “full of chaos”, emergency workers said, with victims in their 20s apparently seen wearing Halloween costumes.
