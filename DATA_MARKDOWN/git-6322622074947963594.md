KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): The High Court today dismissed applications filed by five men, two of them state assemblymen, to be released immediately from detention over their alleged links to the LTTE group.
Judicial commissioner Datuk Ahmad Shahrir Mohd Salleh said the habeas corpus applications have become academic and irrelevant because the applicants have been charged in court.
“Their detention expired once they were charged in court. As such, their applications are dismissed,” he said.
The applicants are G. Saminathan, 34, and P. Gunasekaran, 60, who are the assemblymen for Gadek (Melaka) and Seremban Jaya (Negeri Sembilan) respectively; S. Chandru, 38, and V. Suresh Kumar, 43, who are DAP members; and technician S. Arivainathan, 56.
They had named as respondents Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division (E8) principal assistant director Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay; Insp Jasveer Singh (who arrested them); Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador; the Home Ministry and the Government of Malaysia.
