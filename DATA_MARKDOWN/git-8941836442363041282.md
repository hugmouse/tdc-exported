NEW YORK (AP) - About 1,000 people protesting what they say is New York police brutality marched through downtown Brooklyn, chanting “no justice, no peace!”
The peaceful protesters filled main avenues Friday evening as they passed the Barclays Center arena where the Brooklyn Nets play. The march came several days after a video emerged on social media showing police officers fighting with teenagers inside city subway stations.
Marchers say they oppose what they consider over-policing of the subway system.
The protest comes after a period in which the New York Police Department has been under scrutiny for several shootings of armed civilians.
No arrests were reported on Friday.
