Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on November 1 asked mining major Coal India Ltd to fast track its ambitious one billion tonne production target and look to achieve the goal by 2023-24.
The state-owned company had earlier said it would meet the target by the fiscal 2025-26.
"You (CIL) will have to fast track the one billion tonne target to 2023-24, as the current growth is not enough. There is no question of 2025-26. I will ensure all support to CIL in this endeavour," Joshi said.
