An Australian convicted of terrorism has implicated a Danish national in the plot to blow up a Russian aircraft that crashed in 2015 shortly after taking-off from Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh airport, a Danish newspaper reported on Wednesday.ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed 224 people.In a report published on its website, DR Newspaper said its information was based on statements made by Khalid al-Khayat.Khayat was convicted in Australia earlier this year on charges of planning to blow up a passenger plane carrying 400 people during a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi in 2017.The paper said Danish and other foreign intelligence believe that the Danish, Bassil Hassan, is also involved in 2017’s incident.It noted that the terrorist didn’t succeed to carry out this attack after the Australian police confiscated a meat chopping machine with explosives hidden inside.It also explained that Khayat told the police that those who tried to blow up the plane in Sydney were also behind the bombing of the Russian aircraft above Egypt.The Danish newspaper pointed out that its information is also based on court documents in Australia, adding that it confirms that Hassan was a key figure in ISIS “foreign operations.”Hassan has been put on the wanted list since February 2013, when he disguised as a postman in an attempt to kill Lars Hedegaard, a writer known for criticizing Muslims, the paper said.According to the police, Hassan fled Denmark to Lebanon and then to Syria, where he joined ISIS.The paper pointed out that Hassan has been reported more than once that he was killed, but this has not been officially confirmed.
