MADISON, Wis. - The state Senate has signed off on two bills that would stiffen drunken driving penalties -- and potentially generate millions of dollars in new prison costs.
The first bill would establish a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle. State prison officials estimate the change would cost them $525,100 in operating costs annually.
The Senate passed the measure on a voice vote Tuesday. The Assembly passed it in June. It goes next to Gov. Tony Evers.
The other bill would increase the minimum time in prison for a 5th or 6th offense from six months to 18 months. Prison officials estimate the change would generate $13.6 million in additional operating costs annually.
The Senate passed the proposal on a voice vote Tuesday. It goes next to the Assembly.
