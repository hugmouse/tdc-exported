Throwback Thursdays call for some priceless photos from our favourite celebs. This time around, it was actress Kangana Ranaut’s childhood photo that made its way online. The photo sees a group of girls, dressed in their best colourful traditional attire.
After a good look at the photo, it’s not hard to notice which cutie is Kangna.
Interestingly, this photo comes just days after the actress shared a video of herself learning Kathak for her upcoming film ‘Thalaivi’, a biopic on late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa .
However, it looks like the biopic hit a roadblock recently when the Madras High Court on issued a notice to director Gowtham Vasudev Menon and others on a plea opposing their proposed bilingual biopic on the late Tamil Nadu chief minister. Justice K.Kalyanasundaram sought the response of Menon and filmmakers Vishnu Vardhan Induri and A L Vijay when an application arising out of a suit filed by Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa Jayakumar came up for hearing.
