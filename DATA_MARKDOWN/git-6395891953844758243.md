An Arizona couple is accused of selling more than $2.7 million in stolen property, authorities said.
Zach Robbins, 42, and his wife, Jie Robbins, 47, were arrested at their Gilbert home Friday, KNXV reported. They were charged with trafficking stolen property, money laundering and illegal control of an enterprise, according to the Gilbert Police Department. 
During a search Friday at the couple's home, police said they recovered $500,000 and $750,000 worth of stolen, over-the-counter health and beauty products, the Arizona Republic reported.
According to police, the Robbinses paid others to shoplift items from local stores, and the couple would resell the merchandise through Amazon and eBay storefronts, the newspaper reported.
Gilbert police officials said the couple had been operating "interstate sales of stolen property" for more than four years, collecting approximately $2.7 million from online sales, the Republic reported.
Police were alerted to the sales about three months ago, KNXV reported. No other arrests have been made in the case, according to the Republic.
