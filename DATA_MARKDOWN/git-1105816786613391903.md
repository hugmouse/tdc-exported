ANKARA: Turkey and China will fight propaganda spread through the media together, Turkey’s director of communications said on Wednesday.
According to a statement by the directorate, Fahrettin Altun received a delegation headed by Gao Jianmin, the deputy minister of China’s National Radio and Television Administration.
During the meeting, Altun said: “We think Turkey and China should work in the new period in very close coordination on media and communications within the new cooperation philosophy.”
Underlining that Turkey hoped for strong cooperation between the two “friendly countries” in the fields of media, communication and public diplomacy, Altun stressed the importance of sharing mutual experiences and producing concrete projects in these fields.
He underlined that both Turkey and China had been the target of international propaganda, adding: “We can fight this undue and adverse propaganda, particularly by conducting joint public diplomacy activities and media projects.”
Pointing to both countries’ breakthroughs in the television and movie industries, Altun praised Turkey’s public broadcaster TRT for its contributions to the sector.
During the meeting, Gao Jianmin said: “We are ready to take concrete steps to further deepen the friendship between our countries as well as establish more effective communication and cooperation mechanisms.”
