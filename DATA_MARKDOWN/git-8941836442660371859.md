KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) - One of the present day’s most proficient offshore powerboat racers is aspiring to earn another world title.
The Race World Offshore Key West Championships begin Wednesday in the Florida Keys.
During his 33-year career, Miami throttleman John Tomlinson has amassed 46 national and world titles.
