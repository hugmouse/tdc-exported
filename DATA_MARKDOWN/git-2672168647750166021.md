Thai Police yesterday handed over Chair of National Prosperity Company Soe Tun Shein to Myanmar Police Force, in Tachilek Township, said Police Brig-Gen Zaw Khin Aung of Shan State Police Force.
At around 2.30 pm, he was transported to Mandalay by flight under tight security.
“The police headquarters informed us about the transfer of a fugitive from Thailand. We don’t know who the fugitive is. The headquarters ordered us to receive an important fugitive and then transport him to Mandalay,” he added.
Yamethin Township Police Station issued an arrest warrant for Chair of National Prosperity Company Soe Tun Shein and filed a case against him under Section 30 (a) of Mining Law as the company continued doing the gold mining at Moehti-Moemi gold mining block in Yamethin Township despite the suspension of gold mining permit.
At a press conference in Nay Pyi Taw, Zaw Htay, Spokesperson of the President Office said the police would go to Thailand to arrest Soe Tun Shein after the media covered the news about the spotting of Soe Tun Shein in Thailand.
The police also filed a case against Nyi Nyi Lwin, Khin Zaw, Min Min Soe and Saw Maung under Section 30 (a) of the Mining Law.
