RANCHI: Shubman Gill scripted history on Monday when he walked out to lead India C in the 47th Deodhar Trophy summit clash with India B at the JSCA International Stadium as he became the youngest captain to lead a side in the tournament's final.
The right-hander broke current India captain Virat Kohli's 10-year-old record. The India run-machine had led North Zone in the Deodhar Trophy final when he was just 21 years and 142 days old in 2009-10 while Gill is only 20 years and 57 days old.
Gill, however, was dismissed for just a run by Mohammad Siraj.
Batting first, India B put on 283/7, thanks on a fighting 86-run knock by Kedar Jadhav. For India C, Bengal pacer Ishan Porel scalped 5/43 in his 10 overs.
In reply, India C were restricted to 232/9 in 50 overs as Parthiv Patel-led India B clinch the title.
Gill was earlier a part of India's Test squad for the three-match series against South Africa, which India won 3-0.
