        Max Verstappen has had a go at Ferrari, accusing the Italian team of having cheated in previous races as they suddenly had the quickest car on the grid after the summer break.
      
Ahead of this weekend, Aston Martin Red Bull Racing had requested the FIA to clarify what is and isn't allowed when it comes to fuel flow to the engine, with suspicions in the F1 grid arising of Ferrari doing something illegal on this front.
After the specific rules about fuel flow were once again explained, and no official investigation on Ferrari was launched as there were no formal complaints about the team, Ferrari's pace, particularly on the straights, seemed to fall off.
"That's what you get when you stop cheating," Verstappen reacted to Ziggo Sport when quizzed on the suddenly slower SF90's.

        "It's been properly looked at now, but we have to keep an eye on it."
      
After winning no races in the first half of the season, Ferrari grabbed five consecutive pole positions from Belgium onwards and won three races on the bounce.
