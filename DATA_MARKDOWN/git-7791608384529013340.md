A Chinese man, Mr Lv, visited doctors at Sanhe Hospital in Huiyang District in Huizhou city, Guangdong last month due to a “sharp pain” in his ear, per 7News. He felt the pain while sleeping, and his family purportedly discovered a huge cockroach in his ear after shining a torch into his ear canal. Ear, nose and throat specialist Zhong Yijin confirmed the report by stating that he found a staggering number of “more than ten” cockroach babies crawling inside Mr Lv’s ear. The hospital also revealed to 7News that the newly hatched cockroach nymphs were of the German cockroach species known as the Blattella germanica. The mother cockroach also laid over a dozen eggs in the patient’s ear. Many Twitter users are disturbed by the footage, and have emphasized the importance of hygiene. Fortunately for the patient, Doctor Zhong managed to take the insects out of his right ear one by one with tweezers, and also took out the huge mother cockroach eventually.
