Most people have wanted to learn a new language at some point during their lives. Still, far too many give up on their goals because even the most popular language-learning platforms rely on boring and monotonous memorization tactics.

This platform makes it easy to learn up to 33 languages in your native tongue, and you’ll be able to work on your skills on all of your devices.
Also available as 1-language, 3-language, and 5-language subscriptions, Mondly utilizes the latest and most powerful speech-recognition technology to fine-tune your education, and you’ll be able to take advantage of a roster of professional voice actors to stay on track.
This subscription even comes with a dictionary and verb conjugator to enhance your education.
Stop dragging your feet and learn the languages you’ve always wanted to learn with a lifetime subscription to Mondly for as little as $40 for one language, $60 for five, or $100 for all 33 languages they offer.
