Today is officially Stranger Things Day, which is apparently a holiday that began last year, but which I only found out about something like 20 minutes ago.
But that’s fine. There is no point quibbling over where this day came from, or whether we should allow a brand to turn their own content into a national day, because the gifts of Stranger Things Day are many — chief amongst them blooper footage of David Harbour being utterly unable to say the word “grandma”.
Yep, turns out that Harbour, who was launched into worldwide fame thanks to his performance as the extremely loveable Detective Jim Hopper in Stranger Things, just can’t speak that word without turning into a melted puddle of giggles.
Valiantly, the man tries some six or seven times, becoming more hysterical with each attempt. For their part, Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard just sit there, kinda aghast.
Basically it’s a work of extraordinary comedic art, and deserves to be watched in full right now:
