MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) - Surgeons at West Virginia University have performed the state’s first heart transplant.
The university says in a news release that the six-hour surgery occurred Saturday in Morgantown on a 61-year-old male patient from Chesapeake, Ohio. It was performed by surgeons at the WVU Heart and Vascular Institute and the WVU Medicine Transplant Alliance.
Transplant surgeon Dr. Vinay Badhwar says in a news release that WVU has “opened the doorway to a new future for West Virginians, who no longer have to travel out of state for heart transplantation.”
The WVU Medicine program has several more heart transplant patients currently on a waiting list.
