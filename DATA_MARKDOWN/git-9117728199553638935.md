        Renault boss Cyril Abiteboul sees the 2021 rule changes as a perfect opportunity for his team to get back to the top of Formula 1. The French team have struggled to perform this season but will look forward to using the rule changes to their advantage. 
      
"I see the new rules as a huge opportunity to help us as a team. Formula 1 has worked hard to work on a bright future and it is important that that future is now determined. We have now been able to build a good organization and take advantage of the great opportunity in 2021," Abiteboul told Speedweek.com.
When new regulations are introduced one team usually surprises the whole grid and outperforms everyone else. BrawnGP in 2009 and also Red Bull (2010) and Mercedes (2014) have shown in recent years how to successfully deal with new rules.
Renault will hope that they can find a loophole in the rules and come out on top in 2021.
