Lukaku joined Inter Milan at the beginning of the season for a reported club-record fee of €80 million (R1.3 billion) after spending two seasons with the Red Devils.
The 26-year-old was widely criticised during his time at Old Trafford, but has hit the ground running in Italy, where he has scored nine goals in 11 Serie A appearances so far this season.

He netted a brace in Inter's 2-1 win over Bologna on Saturday, and in doing so, equalled the club record held by Brazil legend Ronaldo Nazario, becoming the only other player to reach nine goals after just 11 league appearances for Nerazzurri.
In fact, as reported by ESPN, since the start of the September, Lukaku has scored more league goals on his own than United have as a team, with the Belgium forward netting eight times during that period to the Manchester club's six.
