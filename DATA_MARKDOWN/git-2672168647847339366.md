About 2,000 workers including Myanmar workers became jobless as their luggage factory near Bangkok of Thailand closed down, according to Hittaing (place to voice complaints) based in Thailand where migrant workers usually come to voice their complaints and grievances.
The luggage factory in Chonburi Province near Bangkok reportedly shut down on October 31 citing losses.
Those working at that factory were from Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, and they are now jobless.
Of the Myanmar workers, some worked after signing memorandums of understanding.
The factory stopped operation about 12 days before its shutdown. Factory officials announced closure after calling a meeting.
Following the factory closure, activists and Myanmar labour attachés to Thailand said they would try to make sure that the workers who lost their jobs get the benefits they deserve.
