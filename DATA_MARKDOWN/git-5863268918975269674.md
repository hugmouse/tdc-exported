RAWALPINDI (Dunya News) – Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Major General Asif Ghafoor on Wednesday said that Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s (JUI-F) sit in Islamabad is a political activity and Pakistan Army has nothing to do with the sit-in.
In an interview with a local television channel, he said that the Pakistan Army is an impartial institution and acts upon the orders of the elected government.
Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor went on to say that army is fully focused on the matters of national security.
The DG ISPR further said that Maulana Fazlur Rehman was a senior politician and the JUI-F chief loves Pakistan.
"Pak Army has no role in the election, he said and added the Army participates in the election process when it is asked to do so by the elected government.
Regarding Kartarpur Corridor, he said that no compromise will be made on security situation, adding that the Sikh pilgrims will enter Kartarpur Corridor in accordance with the law.
Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said: "Kartapur corridor cannot be linked to the Kashmir as it is for Sikh community. He said that those pilgrims who are visiting from India to Kartarpur would not be allowed to leave the premises of the Gurdwara."
