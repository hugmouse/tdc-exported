Before Blizzcon’s opening ceremony, Blizzard president J. Allen Brack sombrely addressed the crowd with an apology for Blizzard’s harsh punishment of Hearthstone esports pro Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai.
“We moved too quickly in our decision-making and then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you,” said Brack. “We didn’t live up to the high standards we set for ourselves.”
Brack went further: “Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone esports moment about a month ago and we did not. . . “I’m sorry and I accept accountability,” he said, pausing for applause.
In October, Blizzard announced it would suspend Chung from Hearthstone esports for one year and rescind his prize money after he made a statement in support of the Hong Kong protesters. The move spurred a huge controversy, which even reached the ears of US lawmakers. It would be days before Blizzard commented on the affair and reversed their decision, giving back Chung’s prize money and reducing his suspension.
Said Brack today, “We will do better going forward, but our actions are going to matter more than any of these words.
