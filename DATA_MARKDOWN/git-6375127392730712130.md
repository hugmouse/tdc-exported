NCRPO director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas, identified the slain suspect as Eduard Navarete alias ‘Bordado,’ the suspect leader of the Bordado Criminal Gang involved in gunrunning, robbery-holdup and drug trafficking in Camanava districts and other parts of the metropolis.
According to Sinas, the suspect who is also included in the drug watch list of Barangay 12 in Caloocan City was killed in a shootout in Alimasag Alley in Bgy. 12 at 7:30 p.m. Monday
The shootout erupted shortly after NCRPO and PNP-CIDG operatives under Brig. Gen. Joel Napoleon M. Coronel responded to an information that the suspect was seen in Alimasag Alley shortly after robbing one Ben-Ar Enriquez.
He said that the suspect was about to be accosted by officers when he drew a machine pistol and started shooting while trying to escape. The lawmen retaliated killing the suspect on the spot.
Recovered from the possession of the slain suspect were one Intrated Miami TEC KG-9 machine pistol with a magazine containing several live ammunition, several heat-sealed plastic sachets containing some 100 grams of suspected shabu valued at P680,000 and P2,000 in cash.
