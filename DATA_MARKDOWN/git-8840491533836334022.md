A STUDY is set to be undertaken in an effort to transform Castlebar into a more pedestrian-friendly zone and improve traffic flows at a number of locations.
The decision has been taken to conduct the analysis in order to prepare the town for the impact of the new N5 roadway between Turlough and Westport which is expected to be completed in two years time.
Ann Sweeney, senior roads engineer, said the development has given an opportunity to the Castlebar Municipal District to carrying out an assessment on how traffic flows can be improved in and around the town when the new route is completed.
“I have approached consultants in regard to undertaking a study that could be very beneficial for the future of Castlebar and make it a more pedestrian-friendly place to live and visit.
“The new road is going to have a significant impact and we want to ensure the impact is positive for Castlebar.
“The study will examine problems that exist at different locations and how they can be addressed for the good of all road users, as well as cyclists and pedestrians, with the emphasis on health and safety.”
She has been given the go-ahead to proceed with the study.
Members of Castlebar Municipal District have also adopted a motion by Councillor Ger Deere to carry out a full safety audit from Charles Street to the N5 Roundabout.
