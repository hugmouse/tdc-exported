Springbok captain Siya Kolisi's childhood mentor, Eric Songwiqi, could not contain his pride as he described South Africa's emphatic Rugby World Cup victory as "mission accomplished".
Hundreds of fans gathered at Zwide Stadium to celebrate as their home town hero Kolisi lifted the Webb Ellis Cup on Saturday after the Springboks' 32-12 victory over England in the Rugby World Cup final in Japan.
News24 visited Kolisi's hometown to get a glimpse of where he got his start.
From the worn pitches of Zwide in Port Elizabeth to the pristine lawns of Grey High School, Kolisi has left an indelible mark on his home town.
