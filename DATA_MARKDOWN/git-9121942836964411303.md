Central Michigan’s quick turnaround reached another milepost: The Chippewas are bowl eligible.
CMU beat Northern Illinois 48-10 on Saturday to improve to 6-4 this season under new coach Jim McElwain. The Chippewas went 1-11 last season.
Elsewhere, Virginia Tech (5-3) still has work to do if the Hokies are going to extend their 26-year bowl streak. Six wins is not enough for Virginia Tech to be sure of bowl eligibility, since the Hokies have two victories over FCS teams. After losing to Notre Dame on Saturday, Virginia Tech has games remaining against Wake Forest, Georgia Tech, Pittsburgh and Virginia.
