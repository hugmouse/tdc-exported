A blind 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two of her teachers at her boarding school.
Police say Chaman Thakor, 62, and Jayanti Thakor, 30, have fled after the offences and a manhunt is underway.
They've been sacked by the school in Ambaji, west India, which says it is assisting with the investigation.
The girl broke down and told her aunt of the ordeal recently.
It's said Thakor raped her in September, shortly after the youngster enrolled at the music school.
And the older man allegedly raped the child just three days later in the same room.
JB Agrawat, who is leading the investigation, says further detail isn't clear at this stage.
The girl's aunt alerted police to the attacks.
Protests to end what has been described as a "rape culture" have taken place in India lately.
Demonstrators have held placards in support of rape victims across the country.
A wife was raped by a group of men and forced by her ex-husband to drink acid in one shocking case last month.
The amount of rapes recorded in India is almost 40,000 each year, according to official figures. 
But campaigners say the real number is higher, with victims wary of filing cases because of the social stigma and a lack of faith in investigators.
