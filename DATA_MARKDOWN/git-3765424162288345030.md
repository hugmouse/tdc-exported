Some Samsung smart TV users will no longer be able to stream Netflix from next month,  due to ‘technical limitations’ on older models. In a statement on its website – which now appears to have been deleted – the tech giant announced that anyone with an older model who still wants to use Netflix will need to buy a compatible device.     ‘Due to technical limitations, Netflix will no longer be supported on some devices beginning on 1 December 2019,’ the statement read, according to The Independent.‘Some older Samsung smart TVs are affected by this change.‘In the future, Netflix can be viewed from many other devices capable of connecting to your TV.’The statement did not specify which models would no longer be supported, and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The company did reportedly share a list of Netflix-compatible devices that can be used – but that too seems to have been deleted.They reportedly include Apple TV, Chromecast, game consoles and other set-top boxes.‘As long as you have one of the supported devices, like a game console, streaming media player, or set-top box, you’ll still be able to watch Netflix on your TV,’ Samsung said.Netflix has confirmed the change to MailOnline, claiming that it impacts ‘a very small number of people’ and Netflix members impacted have been notified and given support.‘On December 2nd, Netflix will no longer be supported on a small number of older devices due to technical limitations,’ a spokesperson said.‘We’ve notified all impacted members with more information about alternative devices we support so they can keep enjoying Netflix uninterrupted,’ it said.The announcement comes after the streaming service revealed it was looking at ways to limit password sharing.In October, the company alluded to crackdowns with passwords when Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said it was ‘looking at the situation’. DAILY MAIL
