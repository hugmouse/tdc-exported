Chippa United coach Norman Mapeza does not want to comment the officiating as he is still new to the Premier Soccer League.
Chippa were bundled out of the Telkom Knockout following a 4-3 penalty shoot-out loss to Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday afternoon.
The Chilli Boys finished the game with 10 men after Tercious Malepe was sent off in extra-time, which Mapeza felt was a bit harsh.

"I think it was a good game of football, what I can say is that well done to my boys, we worked so hard, the last ten minutes [of extra-time] we were one man down, we kept our shape, defensively I think we did well today," Mapeza told SuperSport.
"We had some few chances, first-half that's where we created some good opportunities, if we managed to get one more goal in the second half I think we could have killed the game.
"I think the referee was a little bit harsh on us but at the end of the day I'm still new here and I don't want to talk much about the referees, I don't know how they operate, so it's unfortunate to end up getting those six yellow cards, definitely it's going to affect us in our next few matches but you know it has happened and there's nothing we can do."
