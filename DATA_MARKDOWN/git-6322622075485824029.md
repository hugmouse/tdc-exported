KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): A Sessions Court judge who had presided as a coroner in a highly charged inquest into the death of a political aide 10 years ago, will face a graft charge, along with a deputy public prosecutor (DPP) and a lawyer.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said in a statement today that it has obtained permission from the attorney-general to charge the three tomorrow at the Sessions Court in Shah Alam.
The judge was serving as a magistrate in Shah Alam when presiding as a coroner in the highly charged inquest.
It was previously reported that the MACC had detained the judge in July for alleged bribery in connection with the release of illegal immigrants in Kuala Kubu Baru.
MACC chief commissioner Latheefa Koya said the agency also arrested a lawyer, a DPP and six policemen following this.
"The latest detainee is a Kuala Kubu Baru Sessions Court judge. Some cash have been also seized during the arrest," she was reported to have said.
It was reported that investigations are being conducted under Section 16(A)(B) of the MACC Act for bribery.
