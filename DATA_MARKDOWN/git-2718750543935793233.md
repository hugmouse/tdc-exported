Dramas about people with too much money — they’re everywhere! And Shonda Rhimes knows this, as her new Netflix series about famed “New York grifter” Anna Delvey will feature two actors from other prestige shows about the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Arian Moayed, a.k.a. Succession’s Stewy, joins Inventing Anna as Delvey’s lawyer Todd; while Terry Kinney, Billions’ fixer Hall, will join Anna Chlumsky’s Vivian as another reporter, washed-up war correspondent Barry. Theater icon Anna Deavere Smith and Scandal’s Jeff Perry will also play journalists at Chlumsky’s magazine, while Workaholics’ Anders Holm plays Vivian’s husband, Jack. The series, based on Jessica Pressler’s 2018 New York feature (hey, we know another project like that) previously announced recent Ozark Emmy winner Julia Garner as Delvey, along with actor and activist Laverne Cox, Scandal’s Katie Lowes and The Bold Type’s Alexis Floyd. This cast can scam us any day.
