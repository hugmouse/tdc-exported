COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Authorities are searching for an Ohio ride-sharing driver charged with raping a female passenger.
The Franklin County Prosecutor's Office in Columbus said Friday 28-year-old Abdirizak Abdullahi Aden has been indicted on one count of rape.
The Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman in April.
Prosecutor Ron O'Brien says Aden picked up the woman, drove to a "random" location at her apartment complex and raped her in the back seat of his vehicle.
O'Brien says a female Uber driver who had just dropped off a passenger at the complex called 911 after watching Aden pull the victim from his car and drive off.
Uber said the company will support law enforcement in its investigation.
Online court records don't list an attorney for Aden.
