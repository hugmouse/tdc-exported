Following his Man of the Match performance against Highlands Park last Tuesday, Mntambo was a notable absentee from the team’s line-up against Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout Soweto Derby at the weekend.
The Buccaneers have confirmed that the 30-year-old central midfielder is set to undergo a late fitness test for the injury he picked against the Lions of the North.
