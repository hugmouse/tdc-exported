TOPOLOGY is fancied to get back to winning form by beating nine rivals for the concluding Matchbook Casino Apprentice Handicap (5.00) at Kempton Park.
A winner over course and distance three starts ago, Joe Tuite’s six-year-old didn’t get the breaks when a close second to Trailboss here 13 days ago and a 2lb nudge up the weights should not prevent another bold show.
