The Glasgow Subway was suspended after a "casualty on the tracks".
British Transport Police were called to reports of the incident at the Kelvinbridge station in the west end of the city at 3.52pm on Thursday November 7.
Officers confirmed they are in attendance alongside paramedics.
The extent of the victim's injuries are unknown at the this time.
Glasgow Subway took to Twitter to announce both the Inner and Outer lines had been stopped due to a "passenger related incident."
The Outer line has since been reopened.
 
One witness told how people on the platform began 'freaking out' as the train coming the opposite direction "came to a sudden stop".
@speelingmistake tweeted: "When the girls opposite me freaked out and the train coming the other way came to a sudden stop.
"The girls think they heard someone shout help.
"And there were people kneeling on the platform looking down at the tracks through the train."
A British Transport Police spokesperson said: "We were called to Kelvinbridge station amid reports of a casualty on the tracks at 3.52pm on Thursday November 7.
"We are currently responding alongside paramedics."
