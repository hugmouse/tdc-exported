England take on South Africa tomorrow in the Rugby World Cup Final - and McDonald's is here to help you celebrate in style.
Maccy D's operates more restaurants in Birmingham than any other UK city outside of London.
And tomorrow the fast food chain has announced it will be delivering its customer's orders for free.
To coincide with the Rugby World Cup tomorrow, Saturday, November 2, McDonald's is removing its delivery free on all breakfast orders.
That means fans of Eddie Jones's side can enjoy a pre-match McMuffin delivered to their homes.
 
Usually £3.50, it will be available via Ubereats to both new and existing customers, the free delivery will be available on McDonald's orders only - and you'll need a discount code to get it, reports MirrorOnline.
If you're in the UK, you'll need to use the code  MCDELIVERYUK19  and if you're in Ireland, use  MCDELIVERYIR19  instead.
 
You'll be able to order yours alongside the free delivery from between 5am and 12pm midday, meaning that the code will still work after breakfast finishes, to make way for any post-match snacks.
McDelivery is now available in over 950 restaurants, with McDonald's apparently expecting a big uplift in breakfast orders tomorrow as hungry fans watch the big match.
