Going-out-of-business sales at dozens of Olympia Sports stores across New England start Friday after the company was purchased by an investment firm.
The Maine-based Olympia Sports, which opened its first store in South Portland in 1976, was recently purchased by JackRabbit, but only 75 of the locations were part of the transaction. The other 76 locations of the sports retailer will be liquidating inventory and closing stores.
The sales start Nov. 1 at 22 stores in Massachusetts, seven in New Hampshire and two in Rhode Island.
