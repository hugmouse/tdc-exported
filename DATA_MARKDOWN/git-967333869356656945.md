        WASHINGTON (Sputnik) – The trade war between the United States and China has hurt both sides and decreased US imports from Beijing by $35 billion over the first half of this year, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in a report.
      
US tariffs on China are hurting both countries economies' and US losses are largely related to higher prices for consumers, the UNCTAD report warned.
Mexico’s increase in exports to the United States due to the new tariffs on China are said to be about $3.5 billion, mostly in the agricultural, transport equipment, and electrical machinery sectors, UNCTAD added.
