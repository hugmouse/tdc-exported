Cahill returns to sort out some unfinished business
BACK IN THE DAY
The Irish News, November 4 2009: Dinny Cahill's 200-mile treks to Belfast are set to resume after his decision to accept the Antrim senior hurling manager's position for a second time.
The Tipperary native previously managed the Saffrons from 2002 to 2005 and fills the post that was vacated by Terence McNaughton and Dominic McKinley in the summer.
“I believe that I now have a chance to address what feels like unfinished business,” said Cahill after accepting the role.
“When I first went up to Antrim, I had just finished coaching Tipperary minors and we were lucky enough to achieve All-Ireland success at that time. I was relatively inexperienced then as far as senior inter-county management was concerned.
“Through my previous involvement with Antrim and, more recently, with Portumna and Graigue-Ballycallan, I have gained extensive experience to assist me in this new challenge.
“With the right commitment from players, clubs and supporters in Antrim, we can build a more consistent and successful future for the county.''
