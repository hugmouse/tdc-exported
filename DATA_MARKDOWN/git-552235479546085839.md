Liverpool star Andy Robertson has reminded his 786,000 Twitter followers of his nationality in a hilarious post.
The 25-year-old took to social media on Thursday evening by uploading a picture Scott Brown for one would not approve of.
Robertson is well known for being a hardy soul. His giving Lionel Messi a slap on the back of the head as the Barcelona superstar appealed for a foul during last season’s Champions League semi-final kind of summed him up.
But he felt compelled to spell out exactly where he’s from after wearing a snood AND a wooly hat that covered almost every inch of his head and face.
Uploading the image Robertson tweeted: "I am Scottish, I promise."
Robertson again played a part for Jurgen Klopp’s side on Tuesday night when they beat Belgians Genk 2-1 in their Champions League group clash.
The left-back was starring for Liverpool a day after again being called up to Steve Clarke’s side for the final two Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.
