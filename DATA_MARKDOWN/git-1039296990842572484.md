For 2020, revisions to the street naked include a Euro5/BS6-compliant engine and minor tweaks to the styling.
Kawasaki had a number of updated bikes showcased at its stall at EICMA in Milan. One of these bikes, and perhaps the one most likely to make its way here in the near future, was the 2020 Kawasaki Z650.
For next year, the street naked has undergone a few tweaks and some of them bring about significant changes. For starters, while the 649cc parallel-twin is essentially the same as on the outgoing model, it is now Euro5 (and BS6) compliant, thanks to the revised exhaust and airbox.
Visual changes include a sharper ‘Sugomi’ design and redesigned LED headlight. The 2020 Z650 also features Dunlop tyres and a 4.3-inch full-TFT instrument console that includes Bluetooth, GPS logs and smartphone connectivity.
Kawasaki has priced the updated Z650 at $7,649 (Rs 5.41 lakh) and when it does make its way to India, it will likely come with a slight increase in price over the Rs 5.69 lakh price tag that the current version carries.
