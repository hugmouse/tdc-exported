As a work-life choice, Microsoft Japan has found the perfect solution to everyone’s Monday morning woes by making it a three-day weekend which has worked in the company’s favour.
This trial of a no-working Monday has only increased the productivity of the employees by 40% which is remarkable. Microsoft Japan conducted a ‘Work-Life Choice Challenge 2019 Summer’ work-style reform where the employees were allowed to choose a variety of flexible work styles and hours too.
Reportedly, the analysis report shows that employees took 25% fewer leaves during the month in comparison to August 2016 and also used 23% less electricity however the major factor in the productivity-increasing was the meeting changes as they were shorter and were also conducted virtually.
With 92% of employees in support of this idea, Microsoft Japan plans to implement it again in the future.
