Tough new laws are needed to stop another London Bridge terror attack – and MI5 must act to avoid letting suspects slip through the net, the chief coroner said yesterday.
Ringleader Khuram Butt was a “subject of interest” and had downloaded terrorist material.
Yet MI5 and counter-terror police had limited res­­ources and powers to deal with someone who owned terrorist propaganda and so were unable to step in, allowing the IS fanatic to plot the deadly attack.
Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were killed at Borough Market after murdering eight people in their rampage in June 2017.
In his report, Mark Lucraft QC highlighted 18 “matters of concern” and said “there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken”.
He added: “Consideration ought to be given to legislating for further offences of possession of the most serious material glorifying or encouraging terrorism.”
The inquest had heard that police and MI5 did not recognise the threat posed by Butt, despite him appearing in a TV exposé called The Jihadis Next Door.
Their probe was suspended twice due to lack of resources, and tip-offs about his extremism – including one from a family member – were not passed on.
Mr Lucraft said: “Although MI5 must be able to divert resources, the suspension of priority investigations is a matter of legitimate public concern.”
